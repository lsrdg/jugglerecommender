	Likes:
		-customizable graph
		-color gradient
	Confusions:
		-where to find videos since most only have gifs
	Suggestions:
		-show trick propup when selected in list to save a click
		-filter for type of video(maybe contributor filter handles this though)
		-a way to submit tutorials/breakdowns like jugglinglibrary
		-a way to submit descriptions that can be edited until a great explanation is given
			-maybe a comment section is good enough for this where people could also put advice, common mistakes, things to avoid
