To add to db:
	-paper notes from workshops
		-Freeze
		-Machine
		-inverted box(maybe just tips)
	-a few basic ones polyrhythms
	-Add claymotion tricks
	-A trick like 'Asymmetric Reverse Slam Half Weaved Box(4b)', but is a symmetric box would be badass
	-These are siteswaps for a couple of the switch patterns
		(6x,2x)(2x,2x)

To film:
	-2 in 1 outside inside, 40
	-There is an infinity box that is similar to this 'Half Slam Stacked Multiplex Box(5b)', I have 21 of it
	-555551 - 24 catches

DB changes:
	-Reverse chops should be takeaways or 1 beat inside orbits

External:
	-Contact @loudjuggling if his tricks have names or if can easily get technical names
	-look up haavard
	-look up mura345
	-Look into idiosensory
	-Michael falkov video

Misc:
	-I needed added as admin to GA
	-all users emails are in db on github
	-from stefan
		-'I havn't searched patterns for a while and had a hard time finding the list was looking for the word 'searching' or a magnifying glass icon' (stefan)
		-On the add patternform: if the submit button is grey you could give hints what the user is missing
			-followup with stefan

New Details layout:
	VOTING:
		add a suggestion action
	MINOR:
		-Showing views, catches, number of users with catches for tricks would be cool
		-a section that is 'other tricks that sometimes are referred to by this name'
		-automatically remove relationships if they exist further down the line
			-tell users when they go to add prereqs if they already exist further down the line. this probably needs to happen on submit.
		-Chart that shows catches progress over time(like jugglingedge)
	MAJOR:
		-A components section that is like prereqs, but specifically for throws/exchanges that are actually in the trick, not just similar but simpler
		-PROBLEM: names are generally not descriptive, and being so many it is impossible to remember what they are,
			POSSIBLE SOLUTION, 'Technical Names'
		-Technical Names:
			-Is a literal name that tells what is happening in the pattern
			-goes next to nickname
			-only one or the other is required
			-should probably be abbreviations
			-maybe should be a more specific form of siteswap with all special throws/catches indicated
			-could autofill component section with the throws/catches/movements that are used in its name
			-needs a key somewhere
			-needs a way to have keys added
			-maybe keys should have some sort of relationship with tags, like every key should be a tag
			-Once a technical name is set up, there can be a random trick creator that strings together technical components not yet on the site
				*A next level of this is randomly created tricks in the style of a specific contributor
				*Another next level of this is putting custom restrictions/requirements on their creation
		-PROBLEM: the information on almost all tricks is not nearly as comprehensive as it could be.	
			POSSIBLE SOLUTION, crowdsourced suggestion system
		-Possible crowdsourced suggestion system for tags, relationships, siteswaps, names:
			-they have a (collapsed?) suggestions section
			-anyoneone can make suggestions
			-both suggestions and "not-suggestions" have agree/disagree buttons next to them, when a suggestion gets enough "agrees", it goes to the main(not-suggestion) section
			-even main items can get disagreed with enough to fall into suggestion territory
			-contributor added items get an extra number of agrees automatically
			-if an item has low score, but there is no other items, then it is the main item

Bugs:
	-line 395 in store uses 'fullDB[3]' to reference myTricks, this is no good if DB changes, but it doesnt work when i use 'fullDB[myTricks]'
	-if home page stats are calculated on startup, switch to keeping running totals so it loads faster
		-check to see if tricklist or library load on home screen
	-tricklist shows behind add pattern form
	-old gif shows while new gif is loading
		-try immediately setting it to null(if not already done)
	-frame by frame doesnt hide controls for youtube
	-MAYBE FIXED
		-add pattern form and filter often adds more than one tag with single click on smartphone (stefan)

Niceties:
	-look into share message on phone, maybe tap target shouold be made larger
	-up arrow button that appears on list to zoom to top
	-'Log in to join the discussion' message for comments of non-signed in users
	-Sort contributors and tags on stats page(stefan)
	-Update about page, especially instructions(stefan)
	-A wanted list where people can post tricks they would like to have
		-this could be not limited to tricks, but also info on existing tricks
		-the list could be hooked up to rewards, like btc
		-wanteds posted by users with accounts only, or the ones with accounts float to top of list
	-there should be a way to add gifs even if pattern name is not a siteswap
	-An easy way to combine 2 patterns
		-for instance, Takeouts(4b) and Takeout Multiplex(4b) is the same trick, just one is LOJ, and one is juggling_vegan
	-a way for the user to switch props would be nice, so catches can be seperately kept without needing to make seperate accounts

Other Dexes:
	-there could be a section of tricks that are similar feel from one prop to another.(ejc stranger suggested)

Maybes:
	-make a ga for catches input
	-give edit trick its own url/ga
	-make a ga for delete trick click

Frame by Frame / Slomo:
	-should loop while in slomo whether it is going forward or backward
	-should not need to hold down to get continuous playback
	-possible better playback option is a slider that you set the play speed at, if you want frame by frame then you can set the slider very slow and pause/play as you wish, but generally a very slow speed will

Possible optimization: 
	-if inside of each tricks info we keep track of all users that have that trick as a myTrick, then when a tricknsme changes we can more quickly update everyone's database.

Suggest a Change:
	-could be done just like edit, but instead of adding it to the site it emails/notifies the contributor.
	-if trick has no siteswap listed, maybe anyone should be able to input it directly
	-an alternative names section where users can vote/submit a name for voting
		-Maybe multiple URLs for same tricks in instances where tricks have multiple popular names

Naming rules:
-Reverse always means time reverse, never anything else
-If not specified, cross throws switch hands, shoulder throws go to same hand

Reasons it is easier to add tricks on pc:
-When doing a full instagram account of patterns, can leave a tab open to the video currently on and go back to exactly where you were, cant do this with instagram app
-Typing is easier
-Can more easily have a seperate tab open to look for prereqs/related more easily
-cant easily see video adding, would be nice if a preview was added once url was input


Minor:
	difficulty warning is 1 character behind, so when you type x.x it thinks you have x. and shows a warning. this is probably because it is using state which is laggy.

Search:
	-Relevence Sort after search happens
	-If I type in Slam multiplex in search, I should get 'half slam stacked multiplex box' as result

Asthetics:
	-in tricklist, details, maybe all screens that can be scrolled down low, top header bars should hide if scrolling downward, and show when scrolling upward, this way back arrow can always be easily gotten to
	-loading animation for home screen
	-I think 'all patterns' button should stand out more since it is the main thing in the app, that may explain some of the bounces. It didnt even stick out to either of us enough to think to add it to the stack(maybe not ga either)
	-expand arrow could animatedly turn when popup expands
	-move hamburger to left side, and make it's menu a slide out
	-animate the hamburger button in a number of random ways so it turns into an X
	-consider moving name and version into an about screen

Screens:
	To add:
		Leaderboard page
		Feedback Form
		Notifications (Could be used in conjuction with a 'Watch' Flair)
	To change:
		make about, login its own screen
		make expand menu a slider
	Possible:
		-might be cool to show realtime ga data somewhere, like daily users or a map with daily country data or something on site, looks like there is an api for that

Giveaway:
	Competition Based:
		Research:
			Archived Version of JugglingDB records:
			https://web.archive.org/web/20120512143808/http://www.jugglingdb.com/records/
		Pros:
			-It gets users signed up and uploading videos without us needing to worry about them doing lots of repeat tricks just to post which might be the case if we just reward contributing 
			-It gives users something to be proud of/brag about
		Cons:
			-It would be very difficult to create/post videos of the length that many records would be
			-It would be a whole lot of work for users to make videos/count 1000s of throws just to have videos that nobody else will ever want to watch
			-Competition is not one of the main goals of the site, learning/sharing is, maybe we don't want to give out first impressions of competition/grunt work
	Alternative giveaway Ideas:
		-Scavenger Hunt in the App, certain screens hold a code that is redeamable
			for a set of juggling balls. We could tell people that they are hidden inside of normal usage for logged in users
		-Tag us in a post that has something to do with 
		-Uploading original content
			-this could go along with making a way for users to report 2 tricks as being the same
		-Making a share link to some sort of public profile
		-Making a share link to their contributor tag
		-Filling out a feedback form
		-Screenshotting and posting their profile
		-Reward whoever uploads the 1000th pattern, or something like that

Relationship Lists:
	-Each relationship list could have an +add trick to this list button which either allows user to go directly to add trick form with appropriate relationship filled out, OR to a form with a dropdown that let's them pick a pattern that already exists

External:
	-Contact jugglekraze_youtuber, ask about using his stuff, specifically his tutorials as links in the tricks associated with them.

DB changes:
	4440522 needs new name
	5344 needs a new name
	413333333 needs new name
	Do we have a side by side pistons pattern?
	filter for pure siteswaps

Tricks that need uploaded:
	Simple:
		Tennis and Half Shower Versions of:(A few may be done already)
			Backcross
			Penguin
			Reverse Backcross
			Under the Leg
			Neck Pass
			Neck Throw
			Headplant
		side by side pistons
		1up 2up
	Less Simple:
		Time reverse versions of the primier primer video
		Time reverse of lemming drop

Before working on general skilldex:
	-finish new ui
	-stats
	-user suggestions/editing/comments
	-make frame by frame video/gif control

Reasons to get juggledex in really good shape before making general skilldex:
	-Bigger userbase to help populate them with skills, we likely dont have a jol for other skills that can be easily scrapped, and I'm not likely able/willing to spend time filling out forms for other skills.
	-the template will be better and we wont have to be adding features to both
	-im much more motivated to make juggledex better than I am to work on general skilldex
	-we only have a limited time before ejc, the better we can get it by then, the more likely we are to be able to hook users there.

Difficulty situation:
	-If we encourage users to input 0 or 1 or whatever even on tricks they cant do, it would help lower average number of user catches to make difficulty more accurate
	-it would be nice if difficulty of prereqs/related were shown in add trick form



	

Maybe new todos:
	-maybe show the detail of the trick that was just added so they can be sure it is how they want it


________________________________________
Comments/Descriptions
----------------------------------------
Instead of comment section, there could just be a description section that is hooked up the 'suggest a change' button
PRO
-It would be much simpler to make.
-Would be less cluttered in the UI.
CON
-doesnt work well if contributor is not active, this could be beat by having ignored suggestions be sent to mods. Furthermore contributor could turn this on/off so it goes directly to mods.
-probably more work for mods
___________________________________________

_______________________________________________
Two difficulty ratings: Contributor defined, User Average
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-User based difficulty probably more likely than any individual user 
CONS:
	-Users may be more likely to exagerate what they think the difficulty is to make their vote more sway the shown difficulty in the direction they think it should be
Consideration:
	-We need to indicate what the user is to be setting difficulty based on, their personal difficulty or some sort of imagined global difficulty. For instance, should a 9b juggler put 5b as a 5 or as a 1?

______________________________________________

_______________________________________________
Increase number of difficulty numbers
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-There are many more than 10 levels of difficulty tricks in juggling
	-When scoring tricks, it is hard to remember where cutoffs are between difficulty ratings since we have to have such a wide range of tricks represented by each number
	-Nearly all jugglers online who discuss difficulty rating online suggest more than 10
		(See Difficulty online discussion sections below)
	-It will be easier to get accurate averages once we start using user input to determine ratings
	-It makes more room for 2 ball stuff as well as for 8,9,10,11 instead of just bunching everything up at the ends
CONS:

PROPOSED METHODS:
	-Add 1 decimal place. It is a smooth transition from what we already have, and creates plenty of levels of difficulty, it is very unlikely that we would end up wanting more later.

______________________________________________


_______________________________________________
Unrestrict catch inputting from starred tricks
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-Would make starred tricks more special, because then they are actually tricks that the user wants set aside, not every pattern they want to record catches for
	-One less click to input catches
	-Not intuitive that clicking a star will enable the ability to input catches
	-Current starred trick list is far too broad to be useful(it shows tricks I want to learn, tricks I barely know, tricks I know kind of well..), filtering by catches is able to easily show any of these lists individually.
CONS:
	-scrolling through list would no longer give visual indication of which tricks have catches recorded
		-this CON can be countered by having a seperate icon that shows that catches have been input as well. 

______________________________________________



_______________________________________________
Increase number of difficulty colors
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-There are many more than 4 levels(Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) of juggling difficulty,
		it would be nice to be able to see various levels at a glance
CONS:
	-confusing to remember the difficulty ordering for new users



______________________________________________


_______________________________________________
Stats
-----------------------------------------------
	Potential pattern stats:
		-# of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-# of all tricks
	Potential User Stats:
		-# of tricks with catches input
		-# of contributed tricks
		-# of contributed tricks that other users have catches for

-------------------------------------


Tricks need changed:
	-if machine and factory are the same thing, then we should put (machine) after factory, or vice versa

My Mod Powers:
	-names are empty when editing libraryofjuggling patterns
	-contributor name is changed to mine

Awesome but maybe difficult things:
	-a way to save videos for offline viewing
	-Automated instagram uploading if the info(tags, prereqs, ball num..) was in the description


Difficulty Coloring Issue:
	-Ideally the difficulty of tricks that I have not yet attempted should be catered to which tricks I can do, but I havnt yet envisioned an algorithm that can accomplish this. It would would be great to know that I can always look at my app and quickly watch a trick being done that I have never done before and just be able to do it. 

thoughts/ideas:
	-Right now juggledex really ignores non-jugglers. I think there is a great opportunity here to
		 bring them in by way of lots of 2 ball tricks so that nearly everyone can start doing things that are not too far beyond their current level. Something about knowing that you always have low hanging fruit so far as new patterns that you can do is very motivational in continuing to learn. It is not just for new jugglers either, it is for jugglers new to certain props, like clubs rings, with a balance, etc..
	-Different kinds of visualizers that users can toggle between may be nice
	-Other juggling props may be good to put in just as a radiobutton next to catches since there is
		 such a huge overlap of patterns. This rather than a whole new DeX for each kind of prop or different nodes for clubs, rings, balls. Another similar thing to consider is stuff like 'on a rola bola', 'with a face balance', 'ball bouncing on forehead'...
	-Now that juggling.tv is going away, maybe there is more of a market for a site that actually 		hosts videos, we could allow for videos to be uploaded.
	-If we end up doing some sort of incentivised competition it should come after we devise a method of community voting on best representation of tricks that way people really try to post high quality shit so their video stays as the official demo. Maybe an 'other videos' section that lists all the others for posterity.




to see dark theme:
	1) in App.css, change  '.headerButton { background-color : white' to black
	2) in trickGraph.css, change 'border: 1px solid black;' to white
