DB changes:
	4440522 needs new name
	5344 needs a new name
	413333333 needs new name
	Add contortion tag to all contrition tricks(script can do this)
	Do we have a side by side pistons pattern?

Asthetics:
	expand arrow could animatedly turn when popup expands
	move hamburger to left side, and make it's menu a slide out
	animate the hamburger button in a number of random ways so it turns into an X
	Make About,Logic,Create account be screens, not a slider
	Make sort be a part of filter, and make filter it's own screen

Possible Home Screen Ideas:
	Make many different types of featured patterns, randomly select a couple of them to display
	Make a link to a complete stats page under the couple stats
	Put a leader under each of the featured patterns and make a link to a more complete leader board

Other screens to add:
	Leaderboard page
	Stats
	Feedback Form

Small Touches:
	returning to list from details should autoscroll back to where you were
	put stars on cards

Screen changes:
	make about, login its own screen
	make expand menu a slider
	put sort into filter
	make filter its own screen

Gifs:
	-If a tricks name is a valid siteswap/juggling lab url, then we should automatically make the link for the gif.
	-If a trick has a gif and a video then we should make a toggle between the two for the demos

Stats:
	Pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Community stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
	User stats:
		-number of tricks within a certain range
		-number of catches
		-consecutive days with record break
		-consecutive days with catches input for a trick
		-consecutive days with a trick contributed
Desires:
	-A way to go back to the last details trick I was looking at

Before working on general skilldex:
	-finish new ui
	-stats
	-user suggestions/editing/comments

Concise TODO:
	-should be able to backup to previous detail
	-demo toggle for gif/video in cases where there are both
	-Help, about, send feedback, maybe combine 2 of these, but probably not all of them
	-Notifications section(maybe in profile) so contributors can know if their tricks become prereqs or relateds, or if other users are setting catches for their tricks, or suggesting edits
	-filter for pure siteswaps
	-sitwsap before number on form, autofill number from siteswap if possible, copy code from formic
	-Keep track of users tags so if they leave and come back, those tags are still there.
		-only very important if we dont get routing figured out
	-Suggest a change could be done just like edit, except instead of adding it to the site it emails	/notifies the contributor.

New UI:
	-clicking ss in list could open a ss detail that has a link to a detail explanation as well as allow anyone to input a siteswap if it is blank, otherwise allow them to suggest a new one right there so that they dont have to have a whole big form for the whole trick. We probably want to avoid them going in there to suggest a new siteswap and then decide they want to suggest other things
	-Each relationship list could have an +add trick to this list button which either allows user to go directly to add trick form with appropriate relationship filled out, OR to a form with a dropdown that let's them pick a pattern that already exists
	-a way to programatically add gifs would be great, see if there is a website that allows siteswap in url to make gif automatically. If we can get this, then we can even add siteswaps automatically as users look for some that aren't there.
	GRAPH STUFF:
		-each relationship list could have a 'view as graph' button that allows them to see a couple generations back
		-there could be a 'make a graph'section where multiple patterns can be used as root nodes as common prereqs/postreqs/related can be seen
	-instead of star, maybe use multiple flair type icons:
		*Dream bubble for want to learn
		*Baby for barely able to do trick
		*Buddha for a master of a trick

External:
	-Film 4ball sunny side up for guy online
	-tell guy about hungarian convention
	-Contact that guy from the text doc of tricks waiting for names, ask about using his stuff, 		specifically his tutorials as links in the tricks associated with them.


Reasons to get juggledex in really good shape before making general skilldex:
	-Bigger userbase to help populate them with skills, we likely dont have a jol for other skills that can be easily scrapped, and I'm not likely able/willing to spend time filling out forms for other skills.
	-the template will be better and we wont have to be adding features to both
	-im much more motivated to make juggledex better than I am to work on general skilldex
	-we only have a limited time before ejc, the better we can get it by then, the more likely we are to be able to hook users there.


Difficulty situation:
	-If we encourage users to input 0 or 1 or whatever even on tricks they cant do, it would help lower average number of user catches to make difficulty more accurate
	-it would be nice if difficulty of prereqs/related were shown in add trick form



	








New todos:
	-Tag's like 'contortion' could automatically add 'body-throw', another examples 'underarm-catch' automatically adding 'crossed-arms'
		-possibly posed as suggested
	-A way to automatically add tags retrospectively based on pattern name, for instance, give every pattern with machine in the name the tag 'machine'
		-an alternative to this is if tags also worked as search querries, for instance if the 'machine' tag is chosen it list all patterns tagged 'machine' or with 'machine' in their name
	-Unrestrict catch inputting from starred tricks (has a PROS/CONS section below)

Maybe new todos:
	-maybe show the detail of the trick that was just added so they can be sure it is how they want it
	-make filter close when a contributor is selected since chances are they are only selecting one contributor and then going to the list/graph
		-maybe not until we get a way to filter for video/gif, a way to only see tricks with videos was asked for and it would be annoying to click all contributors if it closed every time

catches bug:
	add/remove catches in every way possible, check after each wa if it caused the bug


Database:
4440522 needs new name
5344 needs a new name




--------
Instead of comment section, there could just be a description section that is hooked up the 'suggest a change' button
PRO
-It would be much simpler to make.
-Would be less cluttered in the UI.
CON
-doesnt work well if contributor is not active, this could be beat by having ignored suggestions be sent to mods. Furthermore contributor could turn this on/off so it goes directly to mods.
-probably more work for mods
-------
_______________________________________________
Two difficulty ratings: Contributor defined, User Average
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-User based difficulty probably more likely than any individual user 
CONS:
	-Users may be more likely to exagerate what they think the difficulty is to make their vote more sway the shown difficulty in the direction they think it should be
Consideration:
	-We need to indicate what the user is to be setting difficulty based on, their personal difficulty or some sort of imagined global difficulty. For instance, should a 9b juggler put 5b as a 5 or as a 1?

______________________________________________

_______________________________________________
Increase number of difficulty numbers
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-There are many more than 10 levels of difficulty tricks in juggling
	-When scoring tricks, it is hard to remember where cutoffs are between difficulty ratings since we have to have such a wide range of tricks represented by each number
	-Nearly all jugglers online who discuss difficulty rating online suggest more than 10
		(See Difficulty online discussion sections below)
	-It will be easier to get accurate averages once we start using user input to determine ratings
	-It makes more room for 2 ball stuff as well as for 8,9,10,11 instead of just bunching everything up at the ends
CONS:

PROPOSED METHODS:
	-Add 1 decimal place. It is a smooth transition from what we already have, and creates plenty of levels of difficulty, it is very unlikely that we would end up wanting more later.

______________________________________________


_______________________________________________
Unrestrict catch inputting from starred tricks
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-Would make starred tricks more special, because then they are actually tricks that the user wants set aside, not every pattern they want to record catches for
	-One less click to input catches
	-Not intuitive that clicking a star will enable the ability to input catches
	-Current starred trick list is far too broad to be useful(it shows tricks I want to learn, tricks I barely know, tricks I know kind of well..), filtering by catches is able to easily show any of these lists individually.
CONS:
	-scrolling through list would no longer give visual indication of which tricks have catches recorded
		-this CON can be countered by having a seperate icon that shows that catches have been input as well. 

______________________________________________



_______________________________________________
Increase number of difficulty colors
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-There are many more than 4 levels(Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) of juggling difficulty,
		it would be nice to be able to see various levels at a glance
CONS:
	-confusing to remember the difficulty ordering for new users



______________________________________________


_______________________________________________
Stats
-----------------------------------------------
	Potential pattern stats:
		-# of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-# of all tricks
	Potential User Stats:
		-# of tricks with catches input
		-# of contributed tricks
		-# of contributed tricks that other users have catches for

-------------------------------------


Tricks need changed:
	-if machine and factory are the same thing, then we should put (machine) after factory, or vice versa

My Mod Powers:
	-names are empty when editing libraryofjuggling patterns
	-contributor name is changed to mine

Awesome but maybe difficult things:
	-a way to save videos for offline viewing
	-Automated instagram uploading if the info(tags, prereqs, ball num..) was in the description


Difficulty Coloring Issue:
	-Ideally the difficulty of tricks that I have not yet attempted should be catered to which tricks I can do, but I havnt yet envisioned an algorithm that can accomplish this. It would would be great to know that I can always look at my app and quickly watch a trick being done that I have never done before and just be able to do it. 

thoughts/ideas:
	-Right now juggledex really ignores non-jugglers. I think there is a great opportunity here to
		 bring them in by way of lots of 2 ball tricks so that nearly everyone can start doing things that are not too far beyond their current level. Something about knowing that you always have low hanging fruit so far as new patterns that you can do is very motivational in continuing to learn. It is not just for new jugglers either, it is for jugglers new to certain props, like clubs rings, with a balance, etc..
	-Different kinds of visualizers that users can toggle between may be nice
	-Other juggling props may be good to put in just as a radiobutton next to catches since there is
		 such a huge overlap of patterns. This rather than a whole new DeX for each kind of prop or different nodes for clubs, rings, balls. Another similar thing to consider is stuff like 'on a rola bola', 'with a face balance', 'ball bouncing on forehead'...
	-Now that juggling.tv is going away, maybe there is more of a market for a site that actually 		hosts videos, we could allow for videos to be uploaded.
	-If we end up doing some sort of incentivised competition it should come after we devise a method of community voting on best representation of tricks that way people really try to post high quality shit so their video stays as the official demo. Maybe an 'other videos' section that lists all the others for posterity.




to see dark theme:
	1) in App.css, change  '.headerButton { background-color : white' to black
	2) in trickGraph.css, change 'border: 1px solid black;' to white
