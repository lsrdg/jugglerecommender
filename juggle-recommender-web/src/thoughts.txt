Biggest Desires:
	-Make videos able to move frame by frame
	-Keep track of users tags so if they leave and come back, those tags are still there.
		-only very important if we dont get routing figured out
	-Suggest a change could be done just like edit, except instead of adding it to the site it emails/notifies the contributor.
	-ability to input siteswap for any trick without one listed(or something like this maybe)
	-Either edit or suggest edit of other users tricks

Asthetics:
	-expand arrow could animatedly turn when popup expands
	-move hamburger to left side, and make it's menu a slide out
	-animate the hamburger button in a number of random ways so it turns into an X

Screens:
	To add:
		Leaderboard page
		Feedback Form
		Notifications (Could be used in conjuction with a 'Watch' Flair)
	To change:
		make about, login its own screen
		make expand menu a slider

Minor:
	show add pattern warnings on blur, not onChange

Add Trick Form:
	-sitewsap before number on form, autofill number from siteswap if possible, copy code from formic
	-a way to see info/demo of tricks when deciding what to use as related
	-make consuming tags be added after they hit submit, for instance if they have backcross as a tag, then make a body throw tag be added automatically. Also allow them to do it manually if they wish. Other examples: cross arm/underarm catch, slam/one-throw
	-If a tricks name is a valid siteswap/juggling lab url, then we should automatically make the link for a gif. As well as automatically fill in siteswap and ballNum.
	
Search:
	-Relevence Sort after search happens
	-If I type in Slam multiplex in search, I should get 'half slam stacked multiplex box' as result

Flair:
	-'Watch', used in conjunction with notifications to find out if it gains related patterns or if other users are logging catches with it
	-Dream bubble for want to learn
	-Baby for barely able to do trick
	-Buddha/Ninja for a master of a trick

Giveaway:
	Competition Based:
		Research:
			Archived Version of JugglingDB records:
			https://web.archive.org/web/20120512143808/http://www.jugglingdb.com/records/
		Pros:
			-It gets users signed up and uploading videos without us needing to worry about them doing lots of repeat tricks just to post which might be the case if we just reward contributing 
			-It gives users something to be proud of/brag about
		Cons:
			-It would be very difficult to create/post videos of the length that many records would be
			-It would be a whole lot of work for users to make videos/count 1000s of throws just to have videos that nobody else will ever want to watch
			-Competition is not one of the main goals of the site, learning/sharing is, maybe we don't want to give out first impressions of competition/grunt work
	Alternative giveaway Ideas:
		-Scavenger Hunt in the App, certain screens hold a code that is redeamable
			for a set of juggling balls. We could tell people that they are hidden inside of normal usage for logged in users
		-Tag us in a post that has something to do with 
		-Uploading original content
			-this could go along with making a way for users to report 2 tricks as being the same
		-Making a share link to some sort of public profile
		-Making a share link to their contributor tag
		-Filling out a feedback form
		-Screenshotting and posting their profile

Gifs:
	-If a tricks name is a valid siteswap/juggling lab url, then we should automatically make the link for a gif. As well as automatically fill in siteswap and ballNum.
	-If a trick has a gif and a video then we should make a toggle between the two for the demos
	-Add gif field to add trick form and allow for uploading tricks directly from juggling lab

Demos:
	-video/gif toggle
	-if a trick name is a valid siteswap it could automatically get a jugglinglab gif added to it, even right in the form, if the name is a valid siteswap, siteswap, ball and gif can all be done automatically onBlur


Relationship Lists:
	-Each relationship list could have an +add trick to this list button which either allows user to go directly to add trick form with appropriate relationship filled out, OR to a form with a dropdown that let's them pick a pattern that already exists

External:
	-Film 4ball sunny side up for guy online
	-Contact that guy from the text doc of tricks waiting for names, ask about using his stuff, specifically his tutorials as links in the tricks associated with them.

DB changes:
	cherry picker needs combined with cherry picker (3b)
	4440522 needs new name
	5344 needs a new name
	413333333 needs new name
	Do we have a side by side pistons pattern?
	filter for pure siteswaps
	Tags to add (and automatedly retroactively add to patterns with them in their name):
		Straight Siteswaps
		Contortion
		Penguins
		Shoulder Throw
		Neck Pass
		Neck Throw
		Headplant (also add to any tricks with head roll in name)
		2T (add to any pattern with Active 2 in the title)

Tricks that need uploaded:
	Simple:
		Tennis and Half Shower Versions of:(A few may be done already)
			Backcross
			Penguin
			Reverse Backcross
			Under the Leg
			Neck Pass
			Neck Throw
			Headplant
		1up 2up
	Less Simple:
		Time reverse versions of the primier primer video
		Time reverse of lemming drop


Data fix scripts:
	-a script to make related tags go both directions
		if x is listed as related for y, then y should be listed for x
	-#b moved to begining of name from end (#b)
		-remove the string '(3b)"' from entire db
		-anywhere that has the string '(4b)"' should have the '(4b)' removed and '4b' added after the previous "  
	-tags added based on name
		-takes 1 input, if the input exists in a tricks name, then add "input" to it's list of tags
	-tags changed
		-takes 2 inputs: the tag to be changed, and what to change it to
		-this can be done without a script, just replace '"currentTag"' for '"newTag"'

Before working on general skilldex:
	-finish new ui
	-stats
	-user suggestions/editing/comments
	-make frame by frame video/gif control

Reasons to get juggledex in really good shape before making general skilldex:
	-Bigger userbase to help populate them with skills, we likely dont have a jol for other skills that can be easily scrapped, and I'm not likely able/willing to spend time filling out forms for other skills.
	-the template will be better and we wont have to be adding features to both
	-im much more motivated to make juggledex better than I am to work on general skilldex
	-we only have a limited time before ejc, the better we can get it by then, the more likely we are to be able to hook users there.

Difficulty situation:
	-If we encourage users to input 0 or 1 or whatever even on tricks they cant do, it would help lower average number of user catches to make difficulty more accurate
	-it would be nice if difficulty of prereqs/related were shown in add trick form



	

Maybe new todos:
	-maybe show the detail of the trick that was just added so they can be sure it is how they want it


________________________________________
Comments/Descriptions
----------------------------------------
Instead of comment section, there could just be a description section that is hooked up the 'suggest a change' button
PRO
-It would be much simpler to make.
-Would be less cluttered in the UI.
CON
-doesnt work well if contributor is not active, this could be beat by having ignored suggestions be sent to mods. Furthermore contributor could turn this on/off so it goes directly to mods.
-probably more work for mods
___________________________________________

_______________________________________________
Two difficulty ratings: Contributor defined, User Average
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-User based difficulty probably more likely than any individual user 
CONS:
	-Users may be more likely to exagerate what they think the difficulty is to make their vote more sway the shown difficulty in the direction they think it should be
Consideration:
	-We need to indicate what the user is to be setting difficulty based on, their personal difficulty or some sort of imagined global difficulty. For instance, should a 9b juggler put 5b as a 5 or as a 1?

______________________________________________

_______________________________________________
Increase number of difficulty numbers
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-There are many more than 10 levels of difficulty tricks in juggling
	-When scoring tricks, it is hard to remember where cutoffs are between difficulty ratings since we have to have such a wide range of tricks represented by each number
	-Nearly all jugglers online who discuss difficulty rating online suggest more than 10
		(See Difficulty online discussion sections below)
	-It will be easier to get accurate averages once we start using user input to determine ratings
	-It makes more room for 2 ball stuff as well as for 8,9,10,11 instead of just bunching everything up at the ends
CONS:

PROPOSED METHODS:
	-Add 1 decimal place. It is a smooth transition from what we already have, and creates plenty of levels of difficulty, it is very unlikely that we would end up wanting more later.

______________________________________________


_______________________________________________
Unrestrict catch inputting from starred tricks
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-Would make starred tricks more special, because then they are actually tricks that the user wants set aside, not every pattern they want to record catches for
	-One less click to input catches
	-Not intuitive that clicking a star will enable the ability to input catches
	-Current starred trick list is far too broad to be useful(it shows tricks I want to learn, tricks I barely know, tricks I know kind of well..), filtering by catches is able to easily show any of these lists individually.
CONS:
	-scrolling through list would no longer give visual indication of which tricks have catches recorded
		-this CON can be countered by having a seperate icon that shows that catches have been input as well. 

______________________________________________



_______________________________________________
Increase number of difficulty colors
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-There are many more than 4 levels(Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) of juggling difficulty,
		it would be nice to be able to see various levels at a glance
CONS:
	-confusing to remember the difficulty ordering for new users



______________________________________________


_______________________________________________
Stats
-----------------------------------------------
	Potential pattern stats:
		-# of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-# of all tricks
	Potential User Stats:
		-# of tricks with catches input
		-# of contributed tricks
		-# of contributed tricks that other users have catches for

Tricks need changed:
	-if machine and factory are the same thing, then we should put (machine) after factory, or vice versa

My Mod Powers:
	-names are empty when editing libraryofjuggling patterns
	-contributor name is changed to mine

Awesome but maybe difficult things:
	-a way to save videos for offline viewing
	-Automated instagram uploading if the info(tags, prereqs, ball num..) was in the description


Difficulty Coloring Issue:
	-Ideally the difficulty of tricks that I have not yet attempted should be catered to which tricks I can do, but I havnt yet envisioned an algorithm that can accomplish this. It would would be great to know that I can always look at my app and quickly watch a trick being done that I have never done before and just be able to do it. 

thoughts/ideas:
	-Right now juggledex really ignores non-jugglers. I think there is a great opportunity here to
		 bring them in by way of lots of 2 ball tricks so that nearly everyone can start doing things that are not too far beyond their current level. Something about knowing that you always have low hanging fruit so far as new patterns that you can do is very motivational in continuing to learn. It is not just for new jugglers either, it is for jugglers new to certain props, like clubs rings, with a balance, etc..
	-Different kinds of visualizers that users can toggle between may be nice
	-Other juggling props may be good to put in just as a radiobutton next to catches since there is
		 such a huge overlap of patterns. This rather than a whole new DeX for each kind of prop or different nodes for clubs, rings, balls. Another similar thing to consider is stuff like 'on a rola bola', 'with a face balance', 'ball bouncing on forehead'...
	-Now that juggling.tv is going away, maybe there is more of a market for a site that actually 		hosts videos, we could allow for videos to be uploaded.
	-If we end up doing some sort of incentivised competition it should come after we devise a method of community voting on best representation of tricks that way people really try to post high quality shit so their video stays as the official demo. Maybe an 'other videos' section that lists all the others for posterity.




to see dark theme:
	1) in App.css, change  '.headerButton { background-color : white' to black
	2) in trickGraph.css, change 'border: 1px solid black;' to white
