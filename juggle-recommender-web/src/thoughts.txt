IJA starts in 4 days, and Hungary fest is in a week, we should probably super focus on user experience before then:
	fix bugs
	get individualized tutorials put together
	search for bugs so we know it is clean
	gets more tricks added by popular IGers

My Mod Account:
	-editing libraryofjuggling patterns results in name being empty, so submitting deletes them. Only an issue for my 'mod' account
	-make sure submitter name isnt changed when i edit a trick

-maybe showing the popup of the trick that was just added so they can be sure it is how they want it

From discussion with lucasadverse:
-#b should go before trick not after (#b) since the ... pretty much always hides it until they click
-no need to have 3b before tricks, that is assumed
-request for facebook videos
-request for loop small sections of youtube videos since lots of his tricks live there in bigger videos
-request for loop smaller sections of ig videos
-request for suggest info change of other users tricks

Unrestrict catch inputting from starred tricks:
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-One less click to input catches
	-Not intuitive that clicking a star will enable the ability to input catches
	-A starred trick list is far too broad to be usefull(it shows tricks I want to learn, tricks I barely know, tricks I know kind of well..), filtering by catches is able to easily show any of these lists individually.
CONS:

Increase number of difficulty scores:
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-There are many more than 10 levels of difficulty tricks in juggling
	-Nearly all jugglers online who discuss difficulty rating online suggest more than 10
CONS:

Increase number of difficulty colors:
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-There are many more than 4 levels(Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) of juggling difficulty,
		it would be nice to be able to see various levels at a glance
CONS:

-------------------------------------

the follow and follow are probably the same pattern, can be combined or deleted or something

Stats:
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
		-number of my tricks

Awesome but maybe difficult things:
	-Automated instagram uploading if the info(tags, prereqs, ball num..) was in the description


Difficulty Coloring Issue:
	-Ideally the difficulty of tricks that I have not yet attempted should be catered to which tricks I can do, but I havnt yet envisioned an algorithm that can accomplish this. It would would be great to know that I can always look at my app and quickly watch a trick being done that I have never done before and just be able to do it. 

thoughts/ideas:
	-Right now juggledex really ignores non-jugglers. I think there is a great opportunity here to
		 bring them in by way of lots of 2 ball tricks so that nearly everyone can start doing things that are not too far beyond their current level. Something about knowing that you always have low hanging fruit so far as new patterns that you can do is very motivational in continuing to learn. It is not just for new jugglers either, it is for jugglers new to certain props, like clubs rings, with a balance, etc..
	-Different kinds of visualizers that users can toggle between may be nice
	-Other juggling props may be good to put in just as a radiobutton next to catches since there is
		 such a huge overlap of patterns. This rather than a whole new DeX for each kind of prop or different nodes for clubs, rings, balls. Another similar thing to consider is stuff like 'on a rola bola', 'with a face balance', 'ball bouncing on forehead'...
	-Now that juggling.tv is going away, maybe there is more of a market for a site that actually 		hosts videos, we could allow for videos to be uploaded.
	-If we end up doing some sort of incentivised competition it should come after we devise a method of community voting on best representation of tricks that way people really try to post high quality shit so their video stays as the official demo. Maybe an 'other videos' section that lists all the others for posterity.




to see dark theme:
	1) in App.css, change  '.headerButton { background-color : white' to black
	2) in trickGraph.css, change 'border: 1px solid black;' to white
	*This isn't complete, but enough to see how it would look
