		NORESPONSE EU-Henrys	  doesn't have git cards
	THOUGHTS/IDEAS:
		-The first X number will win for sure, and there will be more giveaways in the future, this way people want to make sure they are subscribed to us.
		-we should have some part of the giveaway be tagging friends, tag 3 friends and you get an entry
		-make them say a pattern that they discovered from skilldex.org

MAYBES:
	-since more and more loj tricks are getting videos and thus ceasing to be contributed by 	loj, maybe we should tag all of them loj. Maybe not if we make a filter for 'has tutorial'

DETAILS:
	NAMING STUFF/COMPONENTS
		-a section that is 'other tricks that sometimes are referred to by this name'
			-maybe reallow duplicately named tricks, but automatically put an A, B, C.. after it
		TECHNICAL NAMES/COMPONENTS:
			-A components section that is like prereqs, but specifically for throws/exchanges that are actually in the trick, not just similar but simpler
			-Is a literal name that tells what is happening in the pattern
			-goes next to nickname
			-only one or the other is required
			-should probably be abbreviations
			-maybe should be a more specific form of siteswap with all special throws/catches indicated
			-could autofill component section with the throws/catches/movements that are used in its name
			-needs a key somewhere
			-needs a way to have keys added
			-maybe keys should have some sort of relationship with tags, like every key should be a tag
			-Once a technical name is set up, there can be a random trick creator that strings together technical components not yet on the site
				*A next level of this is randomly created tricks in the style of a specific contributor
				*Another next level of this is putting custom restrictions/requirements on their creation
	VOTING / SUGGESTED TRICKS:
		-?only show a certain number, and hide any other behind a collapsable button?
		-make tags voting
		-make name voting
		-difficulty voting?
			-maybe just as a temporary measure until we figure out a better difficulty system?
			-one thing to consider with difficulty is that if difficulty is dynamic then it cant be used to get users back to a specific pattern.
			-there may even be something to 2 different difficulty ratings, 1 for difficulty of figuring out and another for difficulty of doing once figured out
				-the difficulty to understand could be called 'complexity'
		-general voting considerations
			-There is an issue with allowing contributors to delete tricks once other users have voted on its properties
			-We need to limit contributors power once community has voted on stuff because right now they can change what a trick is 100%
	COMMENTS:
		-allow line breaks that are in input to be seen in comments

ADD TRICK FORM:
	-demo previews in related dropdown lists would be good, both in add pattern as well as suggestion
	-recommend tags based on trick name
	-recommended related list 
		-tricks with the same siteswap
		-a word in common in the title
		-prereq/related in common

STATS:
	-'users with catches' for each contributor in stats, maybe total catches for each contributor as well, this could be done as a grid table possibly
	Potential pattern stats:
		-# of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	-# of contributed tricks that other users have catches for

PROFILE SCREEN:
	Stats
		-records broken today
		-chart that shows number of patterns in various ranges
		-consecutive days with record break?
		-consecutive days with catches input for a trick?
		-consecutive days with a trick contributed?	
		-# of contributed tricks that other users have catches for
	Notifications:(maybe done with email instead)
		-contributed tricks get new related tricks
		-contributed tricks get other users input catches
	Settings: (Maybe this eventualy its own section instead)
		-option to have catch records public or not(listed in details) 

NOTIFICATIONS:
	-'Watch', type of flair to find out if
		-related patterns added
		-users are logging catches with it
		-comments added

MODIFIERS:
	-allow for different types of catch inputting, modifiers
		-next to catches a way to change/input new modifiers
		-it should remember the most recent modifier used
		-where exactly should it be in the ui?

MAIN TAGS BAR:
	-make multi-termed search
	-change its name (currently mainTagsBar.js)
	-thin lines on sort button		
	-if all ball nums or all associations are chosen in filter then it is just like none are, should we not show all those tags?
	-Relevence Sort after search happens
	-If I type in Slam multiplex in search, I should get 'half slam stacked multiplex box' as result


NEW SCREENS:
	To add:
		Leaderboard page
		Feedback Form
		Notifications (Could be used in conjuction with a 'Watch' Flair)
	To change:
		make about, login its own screen
		make expand menu a slider
	Possible:
		-might be cool to show realtime ga data somewhere, like daily users or a map with daily country data or something on site, looks like there is an api for that

Asthetics:
	-loading animation for home screen
		-not needed if we make homescreen load faster
	-expand arrow could animatedly turn when popup expands
	-move hamburger to left side, and make it's menu a slide out
	-animate the hamburger button in a number of random ways so it turns into an X
	-consider moving name and version into about screen

----------------DB THINGS---------------
To add to db (Some Filmed, Some found)
	-paper notes from workshops
		-Freeze
		-Machine
	-a few basic ones polyrhythms
	-A trick like 'Asymmetric Reverse Slam Half Weaved Box(4b)', but is a symmetric box would be badass
	-These are siteswaps for a couple of the switch patterns
		(6x,2x)(2x,2x)
		side by side pistons
		1up 2up
	Less Simple:
		Time reverse versions of the primier primer video
		Time reverse of lemming drop

	-There is an infinity box that is similar to this 'Half Slam Stacked Multiplex Box(5b)', I have 21 of it
	-555551 - 24 catches
	Freeze Stuff

TO FILM:
	Bumble paper 2.0
	multiplex patterns from that post
	multiplex patterns from paper
	factory paper

CONTACT/RESEARCH:
	-Contact @loudjuggling if his tricks have names or if can easily get technical names
	-look up haavard
	-look up mura345
	-Look into idiosensory
	-Michael falkov video

TO ASK:
	-https://www.instagram.com/p/BCBgAfmEJX_/ <-- ask this guy

DB Changes(Straight-forwrard):
	change all spelled out numbers to digits, it will save space and be easier to search
	'Under Arm' should be changed to underarm


DB changes(Consideration required):	
	4440522 needs new name
	5344 needs a new name
	413333333 needs new name	
	Reverse chops should be takeaways or 1 beat inside orbits
	figure out what to do about armpit-throw tag and apecross

DB Fixes:
	go through popular patterns like box, shower, cascade, and limit their postreqs


DB Duplicates:
	423 factory and factory tennis are both R+L Factory
	Weave and The Weave


^^^^^^^^^^^^^DB THINGS^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Other Dexes:
	-there could be a section of tricks that are similar feel from one prop to another.(ejc stranger suggested)

General Naming rules:
-Reverse always means time reverse, never anything else
-If not specified, cross throws switch hands, shoulder throws go to same hand

Reasons it is easier to add tricks on pc:
-When doing a full instagram account of patterns, can leave a tab open to the video currently on and go back to exactly where you were, cant do this with instagram app
-Typing is easier
-Can more easily have a seperate tab open to look for prereqs/related more easily
-cant easily see video adding, would be nice if a preview was added once url was input



Reasons to get juggledex in really good shape before making general skilldex:
	-Bigger userbase to help populate them with skills, we likely dont have a jol for other skills that can be easily scrapped, and I'm not likely able/willing to spend time filling out forms for other skills.
	-the template will be better and we wont have to be adding features to both
	-im much more motivated to make juggledex better than I am to work on general skilldex
	-we only have a limited time before ejc, the better we can get it by then, the more likely we are to be able to hook users there.

_______________________________________________
Two difficulty ratings: Contributor defined, User Average
-----------------------------------------------
PROS:
	-User based difficulty probably more likely than any individual user 
CONS:
	-Users may be more likely to exagerate what they think the difficulty is to make their vote more sway the shown difficulty in the direction they think it should be
Consideration:
	-We need to indicate what the user is to be setting difficulty based on, their personal difficulty or some sort of imagined global difficulty. For instance, should a 9b juggler put 5b as a 5 or as a 1?

Awesome but maybe difficult things:
	-a way to save videos for offline viewing

thoughts/ideas:
	-Different kinds of visualizers that users can toggle between may be nice
	-Other juggling props may be good to put in just as a radiobutton next to catches since there is
		 such a huge overlap of patterns. This rather than a whole new DeX for each kind of prop or different nodes for clubs, rings, balls. Another similar thing to consider is stuff like 'on a rola bola', 'with a face balance', 'ball bouncing on forehead'...
	-Now that juggling.tv is going away, maybe there is more of a market for a site that actually 		hosts videos, we could allow for videos to be uploaded.

to see dark theme:
	1) in App.css, change  '.headerButton { background-color : white' to black
	2) in trickGraph.css, change 'border: 1px solid black;' to white
	*This isn't complete, but enough to see how it would look
