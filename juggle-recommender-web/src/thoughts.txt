IJA starts in 4 days, and Hungary fest is in a week, we should probably super focus on user experience before then:
	get individualized tutorials put together
	search for bugs so we know it is clean
	gets more tricks added by popular IGers

Autocomplete Names of New tricks to avoid repeats:
	it should be like autocomplete for prereqs except it doesnt make a tag, it just fills in the input
	it should not have any of the ball num parenthesis afterwards, this way the repeat name checker works once the number of balls have been input



clear console.logs
make deployment checklist
find out if tags in add tricks are set to show all on click, maybe i just did it on the bar tags? maybe it doesnt work with '0'?























-------------------------------------

Stats:
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
		-number of my tricks

Awesome but maybe difficult things:
	-Automated instagram uploading if the info(tags, prereqs, ball num..) was in the description


Difficulty Coloring Issue:
	-Ideally the difficulty of tricks that I have not yet attempted should be catered to which tricks I can do, but I havnt yet envisioned an algorithm that can accomplish this. It would would be great to know that I can always look at my app and quickly watch a trick being done that I have never done before and just be able to do it. 

thoughts/ideas:
	-Right now juggledex really ignores non-jugglers. I think there is a great opportunity here to
		 bring them in by way of lots of 2 ball tricks so that nearly everyone can start doing things that are not too far beyond their current level. Something about knowing that you always have low hanging fruit so far as new patterns that you can do is very motivational in continuing to learn. It is not just for new jugglers either, it is for jugglers new to certain props, like clubs rings, with a balance, etc..
	-Different kinds of visualizers that users can toggle between may be nice
	-Other juggling props may be good to put in just as a radiobutton next to catches since there is
		 such a huge overlap of patterns. This rather than a whole new DeX for each kind of prop or different nodes for clubs, rings, balls. Another similar thing to consider is stuff like 'on a rola bola', 'with a face balance', 'ball bouncing on forehead'...
	-Now that juggling.tv is going away, maybe there is more of a market for a site that actually 		hosts videos, we could allow for videos to be uploaded.
	-If we end up doing some sort of incentivised competition it should come after we devise a method of community voting on best representation of tricks that way people really try to post high quality shit so their video stays as the official demo. Maybe an 'other videos' section that lists all the others for posterity.




to see dark theme:
	1) in App.css, change  '.headerButton { background-color : white' to black
	2) in trickGraph.css, change 'border: 1px solid black;' to white
	*This isn't complete, but enough to see how it would look
