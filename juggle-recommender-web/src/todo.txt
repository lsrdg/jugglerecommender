v2.3

	Profile Screen: (Larger section below)
		-upload image
			ian has code for this

	-Add Trick Form:
		-a way to see info/demo of tricks when deciding what to use as related
			-similar to current list, but it's own component probably
			-no catches shown, no relevance, letters highlight, title wont be blue
		-make consuming tags be added automatically in the list

	-add a blurb about random trick box in about

	-filter for 'has tutorial'
		-maybe tutorial should be a tag, if not, maybe loj should be a tag
	
	-filter for day range of catches last updated, in bunches like today, this week, this month, 6 months
		-find out when exactly we are curently keeping track of the 'last updated' time, is it just catches? if so, maybe it should be baby/ninja flair as well



=========
MAYBES:
	Homescreen changes:
		-move pattern name to directly underneath 'pattern of the day'
		-remove 'pattern list button' since we now have permanent search bar

Bugs:
	-Scrolling is weird on add trick form, it i like there are two scrollbars and 1 only 		works on green part of form
	-if an instagram is using time ranges, slowmotion doesnt stay when it loops forward
	-if i am on details and do a search thing and it takes me to list, back arrow doesnt 		return me to the last details i was on, it does nothing
	-putting a comma in a list input, like (6x,4) clears the input
	-star flair filter shows more than just star flair tricks, it may be showing all mytricks
	-tricklist shows behind add pattern form
	-after about 10 loops, videos get stuck with loading wheel,
		/detail/Claymotion%20Overarm%20Orbits  is a quick looper
	-youtube slowmo back causes glitch if details page changes
	-youtube slowmo back doesnt loop
	-multiple tags clicked at once, and not due to fat fingers(stefan)
	-frame by frame doesnt hide controls for youtube
	-MAYBE FIXED
		-old gif shows while new gif is loading
			-try immediately setting it to null(if not already done)

Misc:
	-all users emails are in db on github
	-from stefan
		-On the add patternform: if the submit button is grey you could give hints what the user is missing
			-followup with stefan when i message him about new contributor stats and other issues he mentioned


Niceties:
	-autoscroll to voted on card and make it flash when it re-sorts
		-would be nice if it animatedly moved
		-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27198479/whats-a-react-js-friendly-way-to-animate-a-list-reordering/31080050
	-see if vote thumb can change colors quicker, maybe before work is done.
		-maybe see if can be done locally if it currently is waiting on db
	-showing the GA map in about or stats or something would be cool
	
	-maybe share tap target should be made larger?
		-which share button having issues with?
	-maybe up arrow button that appears on list to zoom to top
	-there should be a way to add gifs even if pattern name is not a siteswap
	-An easy way to combine 2 patterns(just for mods)
		-for instance, Takeouts(4b) and Takeout Multiplex(4b) is the same trick, just one is LOJ, and one is juggling_vegan. Weave and The Weave is another
	-SORT BY:
		-view count, or users working on 
			-maybe not since views are not shown on cards, but maybe this isnt a big deal
	-a way to make playlists, or practice plans, would be nice to keep track of all the tricks of a kind that i want to work on consistantly
	-User made lists for things like 'patterns where all 3 balls line up vertically' or 'easy uncommon patterns' or 'easy to do hard to figure out' or 'hard to do, easy to figure out' or 'tjthejuggler's 5b cascade warmpup'
	-A wanted list where people can post tricks they would like to have
		-this could be not limited to tricks, but also info on existing tricks
		-the list could be hooked up to rewards, like btc
		-wanteds posted by users with accounts only, or the ones with accounts float to top of list





Code Cleaning:
	-how can the timeout in details.suggestRelationClicked() be removed?
	-randomleaderboardtrick could have its name changed to trickOfTheDay or something like that, as well as surrounding variables since it really now has different functionality
	-break up main render function in details.js
	-get add trick can submit checker split into multiple functions
	-clean up any trace of allTricksList/myTricksList
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
	-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
		-is this still a thing?
	-Update root tricks is running more than it needs to maybe
		-this may no longer be a thing

Performance Improvement:
	-if home page stats are calculated on startup, switch to keeping running totals so it loads faster
		-check to see if tricklist or library load on home screen
	-if inside of each tricks info we keep track of all users that have that trick as a myTrick, then when a tricknsme changes we can more quickly update everyone's database.
