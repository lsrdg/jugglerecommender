-clicking anywhere other than the input when catches are editable should make input not editable


Next:
	-make animation less crazy

Refactor : 
	Should break up store further?
	
User Launch:
	-allow users to add tricks
	-toggle tricks by user added trick
	-we will want usernames instead of just email so we can show them to other users
	-hollow and just show thick borders the node with 0 catches
		-this would be done in updateGraphData in uiStore, all through the function there are these:
		color : this.getInvolvedNodeColor(rootTrick.difficulty, 3),
		We either need to pass through whether or not we are dealing with a myTrick or an allTrick,
		if myTrick, then business as normal, but in allTricks we want border cnahed and centers hollow.

TAGS:
	-(maybe?) add style
	-(maybe?) make it so when a tag is clicked, that tag is added to the current search
	-(maybe?) make a checkbox next to search that is 'also search tags', this way if the user knows that the word 'multiplex' is in the name of the trick they seek, they don't have to manually search through all patterns that have multiplex as tag

POPUPS:
-(maybe?)list depends and prereqs
-(maybe?) other tutorials/user content

BUGS:
-adding number of catches when not logged in crashes it
-clicking any sort button creates a popup at the 3 ball sort button
-selecting a pattern in the 'all' list makes it big and stars it just like if it was a astarred pattern, maybe we should ditch the star but leave it big when it is selected?

MINOR:
-Remember how scrolled the side bar is so that when it collapses it can expand to the same spot
-Maybe can get rid of a little lag by updating catches when edit button gets clicked, not every time a new digit is input
-Make down arrow to show that scrolling is possible on cards
-When editing a pattern with 0 catches, dont show the 0
-(maybe?)Indicator for which view we are in

Later : 
-(maybe?)scrape other tutorial links
-Style expand arrows as icons
-(maybe?)add loading graphic
-(maybe?)make checkboxes for showing (related, depends, prereqs) in graph
-get more patterns brought in

IDEAS:
	-it would be nice to compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
		to do this we would want to be able to show more than one popup
		and maybe made the popups draggable so they can be put right next to each other
	-Might be a good idea to download the whole site incase it gets taken down and we lose the gifs
	-A way to make nodes gravitate towards visible area would be amazing
	-Make learn to juggle nodes, some simple 1b stuff, 2b stuff, the more different patterns the better so they can keep getting that sense of accomplishment. All the two ball steps from the various trucks could even be added with ankmations..

COLORING IDEAS:
- The predone difficulty color could be based on all user data
-  Once you have done a trick, it could be made solid with a color that is hooked up to your length. The range could go from 0(red) to users-longest-trick(green) <-- not sure though, this may be no good with one really long wrong screwing up all other colors.
