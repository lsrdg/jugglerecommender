when logged in only, all tricks become unselected when I add a trick to my list:

	**This issue has been narrowed down to line ~30 of store.js
			            const userTricksRef = firebase.database().ref('myTricks/'+myTricksKey)
	**Somehow on or right around this line uiStore.selectedTricks.length gets reset to 0 

Next:
	-make a signout button next to 'signed in as..'
	-make animation less crazy

Refactor : 
	Should break up store further?
	
User Launch:
	-allow users to add tricks
	-toggle tricks by user added trick
	-we will want usernames instead of just email so we can show them to other users
	-if a trick has 0 catches, whether it is starred or not, make it white with a thick border colored based of default difficulty. If a trick has > 0 catches, then color it based on the number of catches where 1 is red and green is the most catches of any recorded trick with that number of balls
		**this would be done in updateGraphData in uiStore, all through the function there are these:
		color : this.getInvolvedNodeColor(rootTrick.difficulty, 3),

TAGS:
	-(maybe?) add style
	-(maybe?) make it so when a tag is clicked, that tag is added to the current search
	-(maybe?) make a checkbox next to search that is 'also search tags', this way if the user knows that the word 'multiplex' is in the name of the trick they seek, they don't have to manually search through all patterns that have multiplex as tag

POPUPS:
-(maybe?)list depends and prereqs
-(maybe?) other tutorials/user content

BUGS:
-clicking any sort button creates a popup at the 3 ball sort button

MINOR:
-not all gifs are the same size
-Make down arrow to show that scrolling is possible on cards
	*should it go away when we are at the bottom?
	*as is an arrow would overlap our tags sometimes, maybe we could not show tags on an edge to leave room,
-(maybe?)Indicator for which view we are in
-I can't delete myTricks for user a@a.com out of the prod db and it seems to be stuck with the old format where
	tricks are just keys, not objects that hold catches as well


Later :
-make popups be draggable divs
-(maybe?)scrape other tutorial links
-Style expand arrows as icons
-(maybe?)add loading graphic
-(maybe?)make checkboxes for showing (related, depends, prereqs) in graph
-get more patterns brought in
-make a 2b section

IDEAS:
	-it would be nice to compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
		to do this we would want to be able to show more than one popup
		and maybe made the popups draggable so they can be put right next to each other
	-2b stuff might be useful, the more different patterns the better so they can keep getting that sense of accomplishment. All the two ball steps from the various trucks could even be added with animations..

COLORING IDEAS:
- The predone difficulty color could be based on all user data
-  Once you have done a trick, it could be made solid with a color that is hooked up to your length. The range could go from 0(red) to users-longest-trick(green) <-- not sure though, this may be no good with one really long wrong screwing up all other colors.
