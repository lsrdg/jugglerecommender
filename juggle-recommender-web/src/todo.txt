v 1.4
New trickList:
	-difficulty added to topRow
		-get meter image and make it's color/indicator stick be set automatically
	-instagram circle/profile image?
	-for patterns with too many tags to fit, we need a ...
	Expanded Section:
		-resize demo?
		-show full list of tags
		-show tutorial
New Popup:
	-since popup is now fullscreen, gif is also fullscreen, so gif fullscreen button not useful
		-we could remove gif fullscreen button
		-we could make gif smaller in popup, and push it to the side and use other side for info
	-show list of prereqs, related, and postreqs
		-exactly the same setup as trickList? if so, should probably reuse code
	-Increase size of popup title font based on its length?
Hamburger Menu:
	-home
	-profile (maybe profile and home can be the same thing)
	-add pattern
	-login/logout
	-about
	-stats
		-special page for stats not needed if we put personal stats in profile and a counter to trickList?
Home Screen
	-Most recently added trick?
	-number of patterns on site
	-number of users? total? currently online?
Profile Screen
	-share button to share users contributed
	-upload image
	-personal stats
Filter
	-add a share button to share currently set filters
	-move tags down to second line
Patterns to add(either video or gif):
	To learn 5b cascade(easy to hard): 55500, 522, 720, 900, 50505, 552, 5551, 55550
	To learn 3b cacade: 300, 330
		-can be done in any cascade pattern we want to have easier patterns to learn, 
			reverse cascade, backcross, reverse backcross, over the head...
=========




Bugs:
	-filter should either close popup or open in front of it
	-Sometimes when I edit a tricks catches and unenable by clicking the popup, it puts an old number of catches in, not what I just edited. It acts normal if i click the pencil.
		-figure out how to reproduce this
	-when clicking a tag in add trick, the tag stays up as a selection until you click it again
	(minor, needs more research)-The thing that makes the graph freeze is sometimes acting strange, with 2 nodes sometimes it makes one frozen off the screen. Maybe now with the explosion less comon we dont need it? Maybe only do it if there are more than 100 nodes or something

Stuff To Go Into Migration Scripts:
	-a script to make related tags go both directions
	-initialize library
	-#b moved to begining of name from end (#b)
	-tags added based on name
	-tags changed

Code Cleaning:
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions

Minor:
	-thin lines on sort button

Restyling:

	-put ingstagram icon on list
	-allow contributors to upload pics
	-we should show the currently logged in account up top.
	-slow video/gif
	-frame by frame button
	-maybe reorder filter sections
	-if all ball nums or all associations are chosen in graph then it is just like none are, should we not show all those tags? should we make the buttons in filter all go gray?


-'suggest a change' form so we dont have to use instagram comments or other methods
	-email through firebase or setup webtask
	https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/quickstarts/email-users
	-on desktop, when popup is showing, would be nice if rootnode gravitated towards open space
		-shrink graph to end at popup

-Google cloud function for changing database to make all 3ball tricks have (3b) after their names
	
-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the popups, inserts -1 into the db
	*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1

-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
	-color swatches to indicate difficulty instead of entire background

-make multi-termed search
-filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
-allow users to add new tags

-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

-filter catches are allowed to be empty in which case no patterns are shown
-can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag

Stats:
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
		-number of my tricks

		
-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
-opacity based on closeness to qualify








Multiple users edited tag Bugs
z edited trick name
z set catches to 6666
duplicated tab
created x account
x had catches from z account
whenever z edits catches they get set to 0
x edits catches and it works as expected

(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
