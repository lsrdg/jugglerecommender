v 1.4
	-add related relationship
		-dashed line on graph
=========
When related is added to a trick, the opposite related needs to be added as well

Bugs:
	-library of juggling tutorial for 'TheW' is broken, remove link from library
	-Sometimes when I edit a tricks catches and unenable by clicking the popup, it puts an old number of catches in, not what I just edited. It acts normal if i click the pencil.
		-figure out how to reproduce this
	-when clicking a tag in add trick, the tag stays up as a selection until you click it again
	(minor, needs more research)-The thing that makes the graph freeze is sometimes acting strange, with 2 nodes sometimes it makes one frozen off the screen. Maybe now with the explosion less comon we dont need it? Maybe only do it if there are more than 100 nodes or something

Stuff To Go Into Migration Scripts:
	-initialize library
	-#b moved to begining of name from end (#b)
	-tags added based on name
	-tags changed

Code Cleaning:
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions

Minor:
	-thin lines on sort button

Restyling:
	-if related are shown in graph, should we remove them from popup?
		-if not, then should we add prereqs and dependents to popup?
	-clicking search or anything else on top bar closes popup, but leaves the trick selected in the list
	-put ingstagram icon on list
	-allow contributors to upload pics
	-we should show the currently logged in account up top.
	-slow/reverse gif (video would be more useful since gifs are now minority)





-'suggest a change' form so we dont have to use instagram comments or other methods
	-email through firebase or setup webtask
	https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/quickstarts/email-users
	-on desktop, when popup is showing, would be nice if rootnode gravitated towards open space
		-shrink graph to end at popup

-Google cloud function for changing database to make all 3ball tricks have (3b) after their names
	
-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the popups, inserts -1 into the db
	*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1

-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
	-color swatches to indicate difficulty instead of entire background

-make multi-termed search
-filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
-allow users to add new tags

-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

-filter catches are allowed to be empty in which case no patterns are shown
-can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag

Stats:
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
		-number of my tricks

		
-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
-opacity based on closeness to qualify








Multiple users edited tag Bugs
z edited trick name
z set catches to 6666
duplicated tab
created x account
x had catches from z account
whenever z edits catches they get set to 0
x edits catches and it works as expected

(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
