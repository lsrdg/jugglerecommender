BUGS:
-Some tricks do not get background changed when selected, this is because their
	key doesn't match their name. Under the object in jugglingLibrary is a list of corrected ones

-right now it only colors a trick as being my trick if it is in the rootlist, we want it to
	color all of my tricks that it shows
