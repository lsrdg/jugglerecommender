v 1.1:
	-make multi-termed search
	-toggle tricks by user added trick
	-we will want usernames instead of just email so we can show them to other users
	-make popups be draggable divs

v 1.0:

	- add tags to filter dropdown
	- add balls to filter dropdown
	-allow users to add tricks
	-(maybe?)Indicator for which view we are in (water mark star background)
	-Make down arrow to show that scrolling is possible on cards
	*should it go away when we are at the bottom?
	*as is an arrow would overlap our tags sometimes, maybe we could not show tags on an edge to leave room,
	- find some coloring scheme that will work for any case including user added

v 0.9:
_______
	-make animation less crazy (vis.js is on archive.org)
	- switch from 3 lists to filter dropdown
	- move sort to search
	- center selection especially when list is open (maybe make graph smaller)
	
v 0.8:
______ 
	- disable analytics from def

==========
POPUPS:
-(maybe?)list depends and prereqs
- related 
-(maybe?) other tutorials/user content

Disappears with filters
	-clicking any sort button creates a popup at the 3 ball sort button

Later :
-Style expand arrows as icons
-Researching other data sources to inform user based tricks 
-make a 2b section
-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
- node size based on zoom
- opacity based on closeness to qualify

May disappear with filter route:
	-(maybe?) make it so when a tag is clicked, that tag is added to the current search(or maybe becomes)

Minor:
-when the user clicks login it would be nice if the login sliderpane were to close, it looks like
	it would changing app.isLoginPaneOpen from inside auth.js, so maybe it would involve refactoring things to put the two in the same file
-make message that says they signed out

FIlter/Sort Solution:
	-A filter button gets rid of everything in the list column, 
		puts an X in the corner to return to normal list view
		There are various sections in this filter view
			Tags
			Search
			Num of balls (thee should not be tags, they should be radiobuttons that if on can have
				tricks in the root list)
			Sort (A->Z, DIfficulty)
	-Tags can be done with this:(put his in the render: minQueryLength={0} )
