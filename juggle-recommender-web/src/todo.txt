=========

	

	VOTING / SUGGESTED TRICKS:
		-?only show a certain number, and hide any other behind a collapsable button?
		-make tags voting
		-make name voting
		-difficulty voting?
			-maybe just as a temporary measure until we figure out a better difficulty system?
			-one thing to consider with difficulty is that if difficulty is dynamic then it cant be used to get users back to a specific pattern.
			-there may even be something to 2 different difficulty ratings, 1 for difficulty of figuring out and another for difficulty of doing once figured out
				-the difficulty to understand could be called 'complexity'
		-general voting considerations
			-There is an issue with allowing contributors to delete tricks once other users have voted on its properties
			-We need to limit contributors power once community has voted on stuff because right now they can change what a trick is 100%
	-'GET ME A TRICK' SECTION:
		-seperate page?
			-if so, what else could go on the page?
			-if not, what page should it join?
			-any user input conditions/settings?


Niceties:

	-automatic upvotes for all related when patterns are contributed
	-contributor url .../contributor/*contributorsName*
	-autoscroll to voted on card and make it flash when it resorts
	-maybe tap target should be made larger?
		-which share button having issues with?
	-up arrow button that appears on list to zoom to top
	-hide top bar on scroll down, show top bar on scroll up(like in reddit is fun app)
	-'Log in to join the discussion' message for comments of non-signed in users
	-A wanted list where people can post tricks they would like to have
		-this could be not limited to tricks, but also info on existing tricks
		-the list could be hooked up to rewards, like btc
		-wanteds posted by users with accounts only, or the ones with accounts float to top of list
	-there should be a way to add gifs even if pattern name is not a siteswap
	-An easy way to combine 2 patterns(just for mods)
		-for instance, Takeouts(4b) and Takeout Multiplex(4b) is the same trick, just one is LOJ, and one is juggling_vegan
	-a way for the user to switch props would be nice, so catches can be seperately kept without needing to make seperate accounts
	-SORT BY:
		-view count
		-users working on 
	-a way to make playlists, or practice plans, would be nice to keep track of all the tricks of a kind that i want to work on consistantly
	-User made lists for things like 'patterns where all 3 balls line up vertically' or 'easy uncommon patterns' or 'easy to do hard to figure out' or 'hard to do, easy to figure out' or 'tjthejuggler's 5b cascade warmpup'








	-allow line breaks to be seen in comments

			-consecutive days with record break?
			-consecutive days with catches input for a trick?
			-consecutive days with a trick contributed?	

Profile:
	Notifications:(maybe done with email instead)
		-contributed tricks get new related tricks
		-contributed tricks get other users input catches
	Settings: (Maybe this eventualy its own section instead)
		-option to have catch records public or not(listed in details) 

Notifications:
	-'Watch', type of flair to find out if
		-related patterns added
		-users are logging catches with it
		-comments added

-Stats:
	-records broken today

Data fix scripts:
	-a script to make related tricks go both directions
		if x is listed as related for y, then y should be listed for x

Code Cleaning:
	-randomleaderboardtrick could have its name changed to trickOfTheDay or something like that, as well as surrounding variables since it really now has different functionality
	-break up main render function in details.js
	-get add trick can submit checker split into multiple functions
	-clean up any trace of allTricksList/myTricksList
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
Minor:
	-thin lines on sort button
	-if all ball nums or all associations are chosen in graph then it is just like none are, should we not show all those tags? should we make the buttons in filter all go gray?


-'suggest a change' form so we dont have to use instagram comments or other methods
	-email through firebase or setup webtask
	https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/quickstarts/email-users
	-on desktop, when detail is showing, would be nice if rootnode gravitated towards open space
		-shrink graph to end at detail

	
-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the details, inserts -1 into the db
	*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1

-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
	-color swatches to indicate difficulty instead of entire background

-make multi-termed search
-filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
-allow users to add new tags

-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

-filter catches are allowed to be empty in which case no patterns are shown
-can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag




(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
