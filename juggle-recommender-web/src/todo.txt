			ian has code for this

	-Add Trick Form:
		-a way to see info/demo of tricks when deciding what to use as related
		-make consuming tags be added automatically in the list

=========	
ABOUT:
	-about page looks wanky on mobile because of new line setup
	-maybe put something on about page telling users to each time they use the app since it is in active development. There was a Stefan trick add where he was using an old version of the site.
	-add a blurb about random trick box

Maybes:
	-give edit trick its own url/ga
	-A special stats page that only contributors get
		-it is blank/unavailable for users who are not contributors and may entice people to contribute
	-a little fleeting survey message asking if they like the random trick offered that just shows for a few seconds after they get the trick given
	-the users number on home makes us look smaller than we are since lots of users dont sign up, maybe label it as signed up somehow

Niceties:
	-donations section
		-on about page or seperate page?
		-paypal?
		-btc?
		-anything else?
	-in details lists change wording of 'suggest a ...' button? to what exactly?
	-see if vote thumb can change colors quicker, maybe before work is done.
		-i dont see an obvious way to do this
	-showing the GA map in about or stats or something would be cool
	-contributor url .../contributor/*contributorsName*
		-why not just leave out the 'contributor' directory and go straight to their name?
	-autoscroll to voted on card and make it flash when it re-sorts
		-would be nice if it animatedly moved
		-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27198479/whats-a-react-js-friendly-way-to-animate-a-list-reordering/31080050
	-maybe share tap target should be made larger?
		-which share button having issues with?
	-maybe up arrow button that appears on list to zoom to top
	-there should be a way to add gifs even if pattern name is not a siteswap
	-An easy way to combine 2 patterns(just for mods)
		-for instance, Takeouts(4b) and Takeout Multiplex(4b) is the same trick, just one is LOJ, and one is juggling_vegan. Weave and The Weave is another
	-SORT BY:
		-view count, or users working on 
			-maybe not since views are not shown on cards, but maybe this isnt a big deal
	-a way to make playlists, or practice plans, would be nice to keep track of all the tricks of a kind that i want to work on consistantly
	-User made lists for things like 'patterns where all 3 balls line up vertically' or 'easy uncommon patterns' or 'easy to do hard to figure out' or 'hard to do, easy to figure out' or 'tjthejuggler's 5b cascade warmpup'
	-A wanted list where people can post tricks they would like to have
		-this could be not limited to tricks, but also info on existing tricks
		-the list could be hooked up to rewards, like btc
		-wanteds posted by users with accounts only, or the ones with accounts float to top of list





Code Cleaning:
	-how can the timeout in details.suggestRelationClicked() be removed?
	-randomleaderboardtrick could have its name changed to trickOfTheDay or something like that, as well as surrounding variables since it really now has different functionality
	-break up main render function in details.js
	-get add trick can submit checker split into multiple functions
	-clean up any trace of allTricksList/myTricksList
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
	-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
		-is this still a thing?
	-Update root tricks is running more than it needs to maybe
		-this may no longer be a thing

Performance Improvement:
	-if home page stats are calculated on startup, switch to keeping running totals so it loads faster
		-check to see if tricklist or library load on home screen
	-if inside of each tricks info we keep track of all users that have that trick as a myTrick, then when a tricknsme changes we can more quickly update everyone's database.
