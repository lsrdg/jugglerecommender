-get rid of popup when signin or insytructions slider are shown

Easy:
	-setShowSignInDialog needs moved to uiStore

Unknown difficulty:
	-make animation less crazy (vis.js is on archive.org)
	-make multi-termed search
	
User Launch:
	-allow users to add tricks
	-toggle tricks by user added trick
	-we will want usernames instead of just email so we can show them to other users
	-if a pattern has no catches input, make it's background white, 
		once it has catches, make its background filled
	-find some coloring scheme based on catches

TAGS:
	-(maybe?) make it so when a tag is clicked, that tag is added to the current search(or maybe becomes)

POPUPS:
-(maybe?)list depends and prereqs
-(maybe?) other tutorials/user content

BUGS:
-clicking any sort button creates a popup at the 3 ball sort button

MINOR:
-not all gifs are the same size
-Make down arrow to show that scrolling is possible on cards
	*should it go away when we are at the bottom?
	*as is an arrow would overlap our tags sometimes, maybe we could not show tags on an edge to leave room,
-(maybe?)Indicator for which view we are in
-I can't delete myTricks for user a@a.com out of the prod db and it seems to be stuck with the old format where
	tricks are just keys, not objects that hold catches as well
-make a graphStore to get stuff out of uiStore


Later :
-make popups be draggable divs
-(maybe?)scrape other tutorial links
-Style expand arrows as icons
-(maybe?)add loading graphic
-(maybe?)make checkboxes for showing (related, depends, prereqs) in graph
-get more patterns brought in
-make a 2b section

IDEAS:
	-it would be nice to compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
		to do this we would want to be able to show more than one popup
		and maybe made the popups draggable so they can be put right next to each other
	-2b stuff might be useful, the more different patterns the better so they can keep getting that sense of accomplishment. All the two ball steps from the various trucks could even be added with animations..

COLORING IDEAS:
- The predone difficulty color could be based on all user data
-  Once you have done a trick, it could be made solid with a color that is hooked up to your length. The range could go from 0(red) to users-longest-trick(green) <-- not sure though, this may be no good with one really long wrong screwing up all other colors.
