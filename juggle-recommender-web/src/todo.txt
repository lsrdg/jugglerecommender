BUGS:
-when a popup is open and a new trick becomes selected, clicking on the empty space doesn't get rid of the popup
-swipe seems to do nothing on android and PC
-prereq and learn next key and colors use are switched


-right now it only colors a trick as being my trick if it is in the rootlist, we want it to
	color all of my tricks that it shows

VISUALIZING:
-we want to easily see at a glance which tricks I can do and which I am interested in
-show name in popup instead of trickKey
