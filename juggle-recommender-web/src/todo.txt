v 1.1:
	-make multi-termed search
	-toggle tricks by user added trick
	-we will want usernames instead of just email so we can show them to other users
	-make popups be draggable divs

v 1.0:
	-test tricks for old users given new username functionality 
	-pinch zoom sometimes resets zoom
	-allow users to add tricks
		- style ig embed ( frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true")
		- potentially allow youtube, gif, IG, juggleTV radio
		- potentially juggling tv
			-they do have embed(just announced that they are done working on site, but will stay up with no more new vids added)
	-Make down arrow to show that scrolling is possible on cards
		*should it go away when we are at the bottom?
		*as is an arrow would overlap our tags sometimes, maybe we could not show tags on an edge to leave room,
		Ideas:
			-this kind of arrow:

			-no arrow solution, just have something half-revealed to make scrollability obvious:

	Possibly affected by switching to dark theme:
		-find some difficulty/coloring scheme that will work for any case including user added
		-(maybe?)Indicator for which view we are in (water mark star background)


==========
Ask Ian:
	-Should we make some initial popup explaining that this is early stages, and ask for feedback on bugs, possible features, explain that data may be lost etc
	-any reason not to make some kind of physical card to leave around juggling conventions? what should card say?
		-www.skilldex.org, @ARflowarts, @tjthejuggler, @ianbreal, anything else? graphics?
Minor:
	-Clicking a popup or the list should bring either in front of the other
	-find sort button with transparent backgroound
	-if the form is canceled, should it clear itself?
Bugs:
	-i think our localhost check for firebase in apps.js is messing with our ability to test on phone because url doesnt include localhost
	-in form, clicking a tag/prereq clicked through into cancel button once
	-we get this every time:
		Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
	-chrashes if add new trick form isnt completely filled in

Later:
	List:
		-Style expand arrows as icons
		-make a 2b section
		-make a 6b and 7b sections
		-allow users to edit tricks that they have contributed
		-allow users to suggest new tags
	Graph:
		-node size based on zoom
		-opacity based on closeness to qualify
		-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
		-make divs draggable
	Misc:
		-Researching other data sources to inform user based tricks 

Maybe?:
	List:
		-showing the count for myTricks and allTricks
		-the minimized list should be forced to stay on upper left but not on the header. The reason being that if 		you have a popup open and zoom in to make gif fullscreen then you dont zoom out before closing the 			popup, the list may be off screen
		-When list is expanded/collapsed change the size of the canvas so the center is the center of vision
	popup:
		-list depends and prereqs
		-other tutorials/user content
		-make it so when a tag is clicked, that tag is added to the current tags(or maybe replaces the current tags)
		-make related tricks in popup clickable(although i dont know exactly what clicking them should do)
		-closing a popup should reopen the list(furthermore, maybe it should only do this if the list was minimized 	by the opening of that box)

thoughts/ideas:
	-get something like x-gif hooked up to a slider to control the speed of the gifs, 
		 make it so if you slide it far enough it begins playing the trick backwards
	-Maybe catches input should be automatically editable when a trick is added to my tricks
	-Current related tricks equivalence is non-symmetrical, for example: Box is related to NBox which is related to 	Luke's shuffle, but Luke's shuffle is not related to NBox which is not related to Box
	-Why does website have red triangle explanation on url? as if our page is dangerous or something.
	-The animation that happens as a reult of going from one selected trick to none selected is a bit overwhelming, 	but I dont know what should be done about it
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online

to see dark theme:
	1) in App.css, change  '.headerButton { background-color : white' to black
	2) in trickGraph.css, change 'border: 1px solid black;' to white
	*This isn't complete, but enough to see how it would look

-calculate dependents for added tricks
-why is update root tricks running 4 times?
