v 1.7
	Hamburger Menu:
	-profile (maybe profile and home can be the same thing)
	-stats
		-special page for stats not needed if we put personal stats in profile and a counter to trickList?

	Profile Screen
	-share button to share users contributed
	-upload image
	-personal stats

v 1.6
	Style Home Screen

	Home Screen
	-number of users currently online?
	-number of users currently tracking tricks?

	Data fix scripts(see list below)

	-when next deploying, make sure to run on prod db:
		add_starred_field_to_myTricks.py
		fill_leaderboard_from_mytricks.py
		set_total_catch_count.py
		clean up '"stacked multiplex windmill(5b)"', make sure it is all uppercase and remove dupes

=========


Bugs:
	-when details is entered via home, and then the details is X'd, it takes you to list, not back to home.
	-if page loaded with a shared url that has no results, it keeps saying 'loading'
	-it sometimes gets a number of catches stuck in its head and when I open a new detail and edit the catches and click on whitespace of card, it sets the catches to the original number. Once it starts doing this it keeps doing it with that same stuck number.
		-not sure if this still happens with new UI
	Will probably be fixed automatically when we fix LOJ trickKeys:
		-in Relf's Revenge 'Related' is shown with 'no results found' message
		-alphabetical sorts are done by trickKey, not name, so lists sometimes look weird

Minor:
	-8,9,10,11 all need buttons in ballNum filter, or we need a different way to handle ballNum filter
	-dev db has a trick called "(3b)", it is left over from when tricks could be editted into having no name, it might not mess with anything, but maybe want to get rid of it

Data fix scripts:
	-a script to make related tags go both directions
		if x is listed as related for y, then y should be listed for x
		-this can be done without a script, just replace '"currentTag"' for '"newTag"'
	-#b moved to begining of name from end (#b)
		-remove the string '(3b)"' from entire db
		-anywhere that has the string '(4b)"' should have the '(4b)' removed and '4b' added after the previous "  
	-tags added based on name
		-takes 1 input, if the input exists in a tricks name, then add "input" to it's list of tags
	-tags changed
		-takes 2 inputs: the tag to be changed, and what to change it to

Code Cleaning:
	-get a better system of hiding/showing screens
		-probably something like a function that hides everything and then just show the one you want shown.
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions

Minor:
	-thin lines on sort button

Restyling:
	-put ingstagram icon on list
	-allow contributors to upload pics
	-we should show the currently logged in account up top.
	-slow video/gif
	-frame by frame button
	-maybe reorder filter sections
	-if all ball nums or all associations are chosen in graph then it is just like none are, should we not show all those tags? should we make the buttons in filter all go gray?


-'suggest a change' form so we dont have to use instagram comments or other methods
	-email through firebase or setup webtask
	https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/quickstarts/email-users
	-on desktop, when detail is showing, would be nice if rootnode gravitated towards open space
		-shrink graph to end at detail

-Google cloud function for changing database to make all 3ball tricks have (3b) after their names
	
-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the details, inserts -1 into the db
	*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1

-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
	-color swatches to indicate difficulty instead of entire background

-make multi-termed search
-filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
-allow users to add new tags

-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

-filter catches are allowed to be empty in which case no patterns are shown
-can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag

Stats:
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
		-number of my tricks

		
-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
-opacity based on closeness to qualify



Multiple users edited tag Bugs
z edited trick name
z set catches to 6666
duplicated tab
created x account
x had catches from z account
whenever z edits catches they get set to 0
x edits catches and it works as expected

(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
