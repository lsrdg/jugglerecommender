v 1.4
	- make popups be draggable divs 
	- add related relationship
		*how to connect on graph?
	- add related filter
	- slow/reverse gif
	-a log in firebase for a tricks edited by noncontributor
	-Google cloud function for changing database to make all 3ball tricks have (3b) after their names
	- A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the popups, inserts -1 into the db
		*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1
	-color swatches to indicate difficulty instead of entire background
	-resizable div

=========

Minor:
	make filter close when a contributor is selected since chances are they are only selecting one contributor and then going to the list/graph

Bugs:
	-if a user adds an instagram link that is multiple videos, it crashes
	-if a user changes the name of a trick to blank, it crashes for everyone until the tricks that had it as prereqs are taken out
		-so we probably want a delete button because setting name to blank might be what they try
	-The thing that makes the graph freeze is sometimes acting strange, with 2 nodes sometimes it makes one frozen off the screen. Maybe now with the explosion less comon we dont need it? Maybe only do it if there are more than 100 nodes or something

-restyle popup information, make collapsable
-thin lines on sort button

-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)

-make multi-termed search
-filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
-allow users to add new tags

-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

-filter catches are allowed to be empty in which case no patterns are shown
-can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag

Stats:
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
		-number of my tricks

		
-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
-opacity based on closeness to qualify








Multiple users edited tag Bugs
z edited trick name
z set catches to 6666
duplicated tab
created x account
x had catches from z account
whenever z edits catches they get set to 0
x edits catches and it works as expected

(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
