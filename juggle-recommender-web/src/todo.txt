			how so? Some sort of microlist?
		-upload image
			where to store the image?
			where to show the image outside of profile?
		-personal stats
			Possible Stats:????
				-number of contributed tricks
				-number of each flair
				-number of tricks within a certain range
				-number of catches
				-consecutive days with record break
				-consecutive days with catches input for a trick
				-consecutive days with a trick contributed

	-frame by frame to hide controls
		-instagram works, not youtube

	-Flair
		-how to indicate selected flair?
			-make it green?
		-remove star flair?
		-force baby/ninja to be mutually exclusive?

	-Think about leaderboard/details

	Data fix scripts(see list below)
		-ran a script that looked for duplicates and only found 2, make a note of any seen

=========
-when a trick name gets edited, does it's name get updated in everyones 'myTricks'?

Bugs:
	-add tricks autocomplete for name pops up if the input is a substring of tricks in the list whenever you click another input
	-from home if i click the details of the trick of the day and then click 1 list item in there, when i click either back button it takes me back to home, not to the original home details page
	-expand a list card, go to details and come back, demo video shows but its card is collapsed. Furthermore, opening a card should close an opened card, not toggle it.
	-it sometimes gets a number of catches stuck in its head and when I open a new detail and edit the catches and click on whitespace of card, it sets the catches to the original number. Once it starts doing this it keeps doing it with that same stuck number.
		-not sure if this still happens with new UI
	-Fixed automatically by back arrow setup:
		-If at main list, go to add trick, hit submit, screen should be scrolled to the top
		-if you go from home to add pattern and hit escape, it takes you to list

	Notifications:(maybe done with email instead)
		-contributed tricks get new related tricks
		-contributed tricks get other users input catches
	Settings: (Maybe this eventualy its own section instead)
		-option to have catch records public or not(listed in details) 



Notifications:
	-'Watch', type of flair to find out if it gains related patterns or if other users are logging catches with it

	-Stats:
		-records broken today

Data fix scripts:
	-a script to make related tags go both directions
		if x is listed as related for y, then y should be listed for x
	-#b moved to begining of name from end (#b)
		-anywhere that has the string '(4b)' should have the '(4b)' removed and '4b' added after the previous "  

Code Cleaning:
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
Minor:
	-thin lines on sort button

Restyling:
	-put ingstagram icon on list
	-allow contributors to upload pics
	-we should show the currently logged in account up top.
	-frame by frame button
	-maybe reorder filter sections
	-if all ball nums or all associations are chosen in graph then it is just like none are, should we not show all those tags? should we make the buttons in filter all go gray?


-'suggest a change' form so we dont have to use instagram comments or other methods
	-email through firebase or setup webtask
	https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/quickstarts/email-users
	-on desktop, when detail is showing, would be nice if rootnode gravitated towards open space
		-shrink graph to end at detail

	
-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the details, inserts -1 into the db
	*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1

-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
	-color swatches to indicate difficulty instead of entire background

-make multi-termed search
-filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
-allow users to add new tags

-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

-filter catches are allowed to be empty in which case no patterns are shown
-can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag




(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
