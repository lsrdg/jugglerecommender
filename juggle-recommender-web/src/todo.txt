v 1.7
	Hamburger Menu:
	-profile (maybe profile and home can be the same thing)
	-stats
		-special page for stats not needed if we put personal stats in profile and a counter to trickList?



	Profile Screen
	-share button to share users contributed
	-upload image
	-personal stats




v 1.6
	Hamburger Menu:
	-home

	Home Screen
	-link to list(find tricks to learn or something)
	-Most recently added trick?
	-number of patterns on site
	-number of users? total? currently online?
	-stats
		number of users currently tracking tricks
		name of random trick with current leader and their number of catches


	Data fix scripts(see list below)

	Seperate catch inputting from star:
		-if a trick has catches or is starred, it goes into myTricks
		-if a trick is starred, it gets a new field in it's myTricks entry
		-python script to calculate the records
=========


Bugs:
	-if page loaded with a shared url that has no results, it keeps saying 'loading'
	-it sometimes gets a number of catches stuck in its head and when I open a new detail and edit the catches and click on whitespace of card, it sets the catches to the original number. Once it starts doing this it keeps doing it with that same stuck number.
		-not sure if this still happens with new UI
	Will probably be fixed automatically when we fix LOJ trickKeys:
		-in Relf's Revenge 'Related' is shown with 'no results found' message
		-alphabetical sorts are done by trickKey, not name, so lists sometimes look weird

Minor:
	-8,9,10,11 all need buttons in ballNum filter, or we need a different way to handle ballNum filter

Data fix scripts:
	-a script to make related tags go both directions
		if x is listed as related for y, then y should be listed for x
	-#b moved to begining of name from end (#b)
		-remove the string '(3b)"' from entire db
		-anywhere that has the string '(4b)"' should have the '(4b)' removed and '4b' added after the previous "  
	-tags added based on name
		-takes 1 input, if the input exists in a tricks name, then add "input" to it's list of tags
	-tags changed
		-takes 2 inputs: the tag to be changed, and what to change it to

Code Cleaning:
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions

List of Naming Issues:


What must be done to firebase-prod:
	run replaceTrickKeyWithName
	change jugglers tennis related 'Half-Shower' to 'Half Shower'
	replace(case sensitive) every OyOy with Oy-Oy
	replace(case sensitive) every YoYo with Yo-Yo
	change Column Box Var related 'Shower Variation' to 'Column Show Var'
	replace every instance of '"Column Show Var"' to '"Column Shower Variation"'
	replace every instance of '"Column Box Var"' to '"Column Box Variation"'
	remove Columns related
	change Columns(4b) related 'Four Ball Rainbow Cross' to 'Rainbow Cross(4b)'
	change Fountain(4b) related 'Reverse Fountain' to 'Reverse Fountain(4b)'
	change rainbow arches related 'Overthrow var' to 'Columns Overthrow(3b)'
	remove entire related property from shower
	change "SynchPistons(4b)" key and name to "Synch Pistons(4b)"
		and change it's related from "Pistons" to "Pistons(4b)"
	change Pistons(4b) related from "Synchroneous Pistons" to "Synch Pistons(4b)"
	change every instance of '"SynchPistons(4b)"' to '"Synch Pistons(4b)"'
	remove "Sprung Cascade" from 5551(4b) related
	replace every instance of '"HalfMess"' with '"Half Mess 1(3b)"'
	replace '"N-Box"' with '"NBox"'
	replace Crossed-Arm Reverse Cascade with Crossed Arm Reverse Cascade
	replace Crossed-Arm Cascade with Crossed Arm Cascade
	change every instance of '"SymmetricGeorgian Scuffle"' to '"Symmetric Georgian Scuffle"'
	replace '"Box Variation"'' with '"Column Box Variation"'
	delete Half Shower(4b) related
	replace '"Relf's Revenge6"' with '"Relf's Revenge 6"'
	replace 'Five Ball Shower' with 'Shower(5b)'
	replace 'Four Ball Box' with 'Box(4b)'
	delete windmill related
	delete 5550(4b) related
	replace Box(4b) related 'Stacked variation' with 'Stacked Box(4b)'
	remove ' (Slams)' from everywhere
	replace "Slams(3b)" with "Shuffle"
	replace "Shuffle" with "Shuffle(Slams)"
	replace "Stacked Cascade" with "Stacked Cascade(5b)"
	replace "Reverse Five Ball Cascade" with "Reverse Cascade(5b)"
	remove related from "Bizarre Box"
	replace "ReverseCrossed Arm Shower" with "Reverse Crossed Arm Shower"
	replace "Reverse Variation" with "Reverse Crossed Arm Shower"
	replace "Crossed-Arm Shower" with "Crossed Arm Shower"
	replace "Shuffler'sMess" with "Shuffler's Mess"
	replace SymmetricGeorgian Shuffle" with "Symmetric Georgian Shuffle"


Minor:
	-thin lines on sort button

Restyling:
	-put ingstagram icon on list
	-allow contributors to upload pics
	-we should show the currently logged in account up top.
	-slow video/gif
	-frame by frame button
	-maybe reorder filter sections
	-if all ball nums or all associations are chosen in graph then it is just like none are, should we not show all those tags? should we make the buttons in filter all go gray?


-'suggest a change' form so we dont have to use instagram comments or other methods
	-email through firebase or setup webtask
	https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/quickstarts/email-users
	-on desktop, when detail is showing, would be nice if rootnode gravitated towards open space
		-shrink graph to end at detail

-Google cloud function for changing database to make all 3ball tricks have (3b) after their names
	
-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the details, inserts -1 into the db
	*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1

-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
	-color swatches to indicate difficulty instead of entire background

-make multi-termed search
-filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
-allow users to add new tags

-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

-filter catches are allowed to be empty in which case no patterns are shown
-can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag

Stats:
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
		-number of my tricks

		
-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
-opacity based on closeness to qualify



Multiple users edited tag Bugs
z edited trick name
z set catches to 6666
duplicated tab
created x account
x had catches from z account
whenever z edits catches they get set to 0
x edits catches and it works as expected

(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
