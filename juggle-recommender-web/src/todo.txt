v 1.1:
	-make multi-termed search
	-toggle tricks by user added trick
	-we will want usernames instead of just email so we can show them to other users
	-make popups be draggable divs

v 1.0:
	-allow users to add tricks
	-Make down arrow to show that scrolling is possible on cards
		*should it go away when we are at the bottom?
		*as is an arrow would overlap our tags sometimes, maybe we could not show tags on an edge to leave room,
		IDEAS:
			-this kind of arrow:

			-no arrow solution, just have something half-revealed to make scrollability obvious:

	POSSIBLY AFFECTED IF WE SWITCH TO A DARK THEME:
		-find some coloring scheme that will work for any case including user added
		-(maybe?)Indicator for which view we are in (water mark star background)

==========
Minor:
	-Clicking a popup or the list should bring either in front of the other
	-Background of filter button is gray, is that intentional?
	-even though I have pulled, I still see my old filter icon image instead of the one that is on the website

Bugs:
	-Ghost catches bug. To reproduce:
		1)set the number of catches on a pattern
		2)add a new trick to myTricks
		3)make the catches on the new trick editable
		4)make the catches on the new trick uneditable
		BUG: the catches on the new trick will now be set to the catches of the original trick in 1)

Later:
	List:
		-Style expand arrows as icons
		-make a 2b section
		-make a 6b and 7b sections
	Graph:
		-node size based on zoom
		-opacity based on closeness to qualify
		-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
		-make divs draggable
	Misc:
		-Researching other data sources to inform user based tricks 

Maybe?:
	List:
		-showing the current count of myTricks and allTricks would be nice
		-the minimized list should be forced to stay on upper left but not on the header. The reason being that if 		you have a popup open and zoom in to make gif fullscreen then you dont zoom out before closing the 			popup, the list may be off screen
		-When list is expanded/collapsed change the size of the canvas so the center is the center of vision
	popup:
		-list depends and prereqs
		-other tutorials/user content
		-make it so when a tag is clicked, that tag is added to the current tags(or maybe replaces the current tags)
		-make related tricks in popup clickable(although i dont know exactly what clicking them should do)
		-closing a popup should reopen the list(furthermore, maybe it should only do this if the list was minimized 	by the opening of that box)
		-remove minimize button from fullscreen gif and make tapping anywhere minimize

thoughts/ideas:
	-get something like x-gif hooked up to a slider to control the speed of the gifs, 
		 make it so if you slide it far enough it begins playing the trick backwards
	-Maybe catches input should be automatically editable when a trick is added to my tricks
	-Current related tricks equivalence is non-symmetrical, for example: Box is related to NBox which is related to 	Luke's shuffle, but Luke's shuffle is not related to NBox which is not related to Box
	-Why does website have red triangle explanation on url? as if our page is dangerous or something.
	-The animation that happens as a reult of going from one selected trick to none selected is a bit overwhelming, 	but I dont know what should be done about it
