v2.4

	Profile Screen: (Larger section below)
		-upload image
			ian has code for this

	-Add Trick Form:
		-make consuming tags be added automatically in the list
			-need a fleeting message to tell that this happenend	

	Filter
		-filter for day range of catches last updated, in bunches like today, this week, this month, 6 months
			-find out when exactly we are curently keeping track of the 'last updated' time, is it just catches? if so, maybe it should be baby/ninja flair as well
		-filter for 'has tutorial'
			-make it it's own section
		-make family filter
			-families seem similar to the playlist thing, maybe the two can be combined somehow

	-modignore is currently turned off just by having no names in store.mods because I couldn't figure out how to actually ignore them in GA

	-change 'users with catches' to 'users working on'
		-do this on details as well as profile stats
		-include ninja and baby flair in count
		-make a 'tricks being worked on stat'
		-hover over to explain

	-if editing a trick, and typing into tags, if there is only 1 result left, it doesnt show the dropdown. this is not the case with normal add trick or filter
		-maybe this will be fixed by hooking up improved search to smallTrickList

	Search observations:
		-should we implement the new search everywhere?
			-autocompletes?
			-smallTrickList?
				we may want to do a secondary sort, like first relevance, but then if relevance is equal go to difficulty

=========
//give message if flair filter clicked and (!authStore.user)

Stefan suggested we do suggestions for tags and siteswap like we did relateds
	
MAYBES:
	GA hooked up to browser back button? our back button? Seperate GAs or same?
	Homescreen changes:
		-move pattern name to directly underneath 'pattern of the day'
		-remove 'pattern list button' since we now have permanent search bar
	-Patterns mentioned in comments could be links
	-to make the lists less cluttery, dont show patterns with balls of more than 1 more for prereqs, and opposite for post? 

Bugs:
	-if you log out/log in while there is something in the search box it doesnt apply to the list
	-there is a problem with the 'there is a problem with...' message
	-if the name of a trick with lots of relationships is changed it works for a while and then crashes, seems like the change worked after refresh though
	-in mozilla, add pattern form, video tame range labels are shifted very far to the left
	-Scrolling is weird on add trick form, it i like there are two scrollbars and 1 only 		works on green part of form
	-if an instagram is using time ranges, slowmotion doesnt stay when it loops forward
	-after about 10 loops, videos get stuck with loading wheel,
		/detail/Claymotion%20Overarm%20Orbits  is a quick looper
	-youtube slowmo back causes glitch if details page changes
	-youtube slowmo back doesnt loop
	-frame by frame doesnt hide controls for youtube
	-MAYBE FIXED
		-old gif shows while new gif is loading
			-try immediately setting it to null(if not already done)

Misc:
	-all users emails are in db on github
	-from stefan
		-On the add patternform: if the submit button is grey you could give hints what the user is missing
			-followup with stefan when i message him about new contributor stats and other issues he mentioned


Niceties:
	-autoscroll to voted on card and make it flash when it re-sorts
		-would be nice if it animatedly moved
		-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27198479/whats-a-react-js-friendly-way-to-animate-a-list-reordering/31080050
	-see if vote thumb can change colors quicker, maybe before work is done.
		-maybe see if can be done locally if it currently is waiting on db
	-showing the GA map in about or stats or something would be cool
	
	-maybe share tap target should be made larger?
		-which share button having issues with?
	-maybe up arrow button that appears on list to zoom to top
	-there should be a way to add gifs even if pattern name is not a siteswap
	-An easy way to combine 2 patterns(just for mods)
		-for instance, Takeouts(4b) and Takeout Multiplex(4b) is the same trick, just one is LOJ, and one is juggling_vegan. Weave and The Weave is another
	-SORT BY:
		-view count, or users working on 
			-maybe not since views are not shown on cards, but maybe this isnt a big deal
	-a way to make playlists, or practice plans, would be nice to keep track of all the tricks of a kind that i want to work on consistantly
	-User made lists for things like 'patterns where all 3 balls line up vertically' or 'easy uncommon patterns' or 'easy to do hard to figure out' or 'hard to do, easy to figure out' or 'tjthejuggler's 5b cascade warmpup'
	-A wanted list where people can post tricks they would like to have
		-this could be not limited to tricks, but also info on existing tricks
		-the list could be hooked up to rewards, like btc
		-wanteds posted by users with accounts only, or the ones with accounts float to top of list





Code Cleaning:
	-all those setStates in addTrickFOrm in componentdidmount, if (editing trick) may be redundant
	-reduce stuff at begining of filterstore into a more general function
	-how can the timeout in details.suggestRelationClicked() be removed?
	-randomleaderboardtrick could have its name changed to trickOfTheDay or something like that, as well as surrounding variables since it really now has different functionality
	-break up main render function in details.js
	-get add trick can submit checker split into multiple functions
	-clean up any trace of allTricksList/myTricksList
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
	-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
		-is this still a thing?
	-Update root tricks is running more than it needs to maybe
		-this may no longer be a thing

Performance Improvement:
	-if home page stats are calculated on startup, switch to keeping running totals so it loads faster
		-check to see if tricklist or library load on home screen
	-if inside of each tricks info we keep track of all users that have that trick as a myTrick, then when a tricknsme changes we can more quickly update everyone's database.

		-'shower' has 47/54 good results
		-'cascade' has 54/55 good results 
		-'revenge' has 7/76 good results (because it gets a lot of 'reverse' results)
