v 1.1:
	-make multi-termed search
	-toggle tricks by user added trick
	-we will want usernames instead of just email so we can show them to other users
	-make popups be draggable divs

v 1.0:
	-allow users to add tricks
	-Make down arrow to show that scrolling is possible on cards
		*should it go away when we are at the bottom?
		*as is an arrow would overlap our tags sometimes, maybe we could not show tags on an edge to leave room,
		IDEAS:
			-this kind of arrow:

			-no arrow solution, just have something half-revealed to make scrollability obvious:

	POSSIBLY AFFECTED IF WE SWITCH TO A DARK THEME:
		-find some coloring scheme that will work for any case including user added
		-(maybe?)Indicator for which view we are in (water mark star background)

==========
Minor:
-Clicking a popup or the list should bring either in front of the other
-Background of filter button is gray, should it be?
-even though I have pulled, I still see my old filter icon image instead of the one that is on the website

Later :
-Style expand arrows as icons
-Researching other data sources to inform user based tricks 
-make a 2b section
-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
-node size based on zoom
-opacity based on closeness to qualify

MAYBE?:
	-closing a popup should reopen the list(furthermore, maybe it should only do this if the list was minimized by the opening of that box)
	-the minimized list should be forced to stay on upper left but not on the header. The reason being that if you have a popup open and zoom in to make gif fullscreen then you dont zoom out before closing the popup, the list may be off screen
	-remove minimize button from fullscreen gif and make a tap anywhere minimize
	-When list is expanded/collapsed change the size of the canvas so the center is the center of vision
	-make it so when a tag is clicked, that tag is added to the current tags(or maybe replaces the current tags)
	-make related tricks in popup clickable(although i dont know exactly what clicking them should do)
	POPUPS:
		-list depends and prereqs
		-other tutorials/user content

IDEAS:
	-get something like x-gif hooked up to a slider to control the speed of the gifs, 
		 make it so if you slide it far enough it begins playing the trick backwards
	-Maybe catches input should be automatically editable when a trick is added to my tricks

NOTES:
	-Current related tricks equivalence is non-symmetrical, for example: Box is related to NBox which is related to Luke's shuffle, but Luke's shuffle is not related to NBox which is not related to Box
	-Why does website have red triangle explanation on url? as if our page is dangerous or something.
	-The animation that happens as a reult of going from one selected trick to none selected is a bit overwhelming, but I dont know what should be done about it
