-Style expand arrows as icons
- add loading graphic
- make checkboxes for showing (related, depends, prereqs) in graph

POSSIBLE SELECTION OPTION:
-Don't show the entire 'all tricks' list in the graph
-Allow multiple selected tricks
-show all selected tricks in graph
-make a select all button to select all of the tricks in the list (show all relationships, maybe default view)

DIFFICULTY
-represent difficulty in nodes(maybe with border color, node shape, something else) Maybe color all deps and prereqs by difficulty from green to red, where prereqs are biased to be more green since the dependent has already been done. 

USERS:
-create user
-login
-allow users to add tricks
-toggle tricks by user added tricks

BUGS:
-when a popup is open and a new trick becomes selected, clicking on the empty space doesn't get rid of the popup
-swipe seems to do nothing on android and PC
-prereq and learn next key and colors use are switched


-right now it only colors a trick as being my trick if it is in the rootlist, we want it to
	color all of my tricks that it shows

VISUALIZING:
-we want to easily see at a glance which tricks I can do and which I am interested in

-show name in popup instead of trickKey

-if they have my tricks, default to my tricks when they get on site

-create initial filter based on some keyword

MOBILE:
-make legend good for mobile(smaller)
-fix list card styles for retina
- make gif smaller for rtina 

Later : 

-status property for tricks, 'done'
- clean remaining prereq data exceptions
	there is an orka's mess and an orka's mes
