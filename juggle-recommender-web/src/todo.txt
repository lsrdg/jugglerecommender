v 1.3:

v 1.2:
	-Google cloud function for changing database to make all 3ball tricks have (3b) after their names
	-make popups be draggable divs
	-enhance about section
		-explain edges
		-talk about adding tricks
	-sort tricks by date catches updated
	-show contributor on popup

v 1.1:
	

	
	




==========


-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
-toggle tricks by user added trick(a tab-esque filter for contributors handles this nicely and makes it possible see specific contributors tricks)

-make multi-termed search


Minor:	

	-Clicking a popup or the list should bring either in front of the other
	-find sort button with transparent background
		-is this still needed?
	-make filter button change colors when selected, this involves gettin it as svg
	-Add trick form should disappear on click off
	-add 'since last updated' to sort
	-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
	-An input in form for dependents
		-it should also update the library entry for the dependent with the appropriate prereq
	-maybe put updateRootTricks() in selectLastUpdated()
		-just make sure they are always used together first

Bugs:
	Popup
		Youtube
			-youtube videos don't autoplay
		Instagram
			-Instagram has no way to loop, they want you to go to their site to loop
				A possible solution may be to check to see when the video ends and then reload the embed
	Misc
		-trick popup and header can both be used to zoom and position each other, but list cannot be used that why. What's up with that?
	Maybe unimportant
		-we get this every time:
			Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
		-Update root tricks is running 4 times

Later:
	List:
		-Style expand arrows as icons(Still an issue?)
		-make a 2b section
		-make a 6b and 7b sections
		-allow users to edit tricks that they have contributed
		-allow users to suggest new tags
	Graph:
		-node size based on zoom
		-opacity based on closeness to qualify
		-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
	Misc:
		-Researching other data sources to inform user based tricks(what does this mean?)
		-maybe make a dark theme
	Popup:
		-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the popups
	Add Trick Form:
		-in form, I clicked a tag and the click clicked cancel because it was behind it. This has 
			only happened once, maybe i double clicked without realising.
				*solution is either to limit height(seems like library has no option for this, either make our own tags or edit library) of dropdown or make a timer(even if we do this we still have a mile long list, we could limit list length by requiring more than 1 letter to show suggestions)

----------------

V1.2 bugs:	
	-reditor said they didn't understand the meaning of the edges between patterns
	-i dont think most people know what 'prereqs' means

Filtering:
	-Filter for user added
	-Make a filter for number of generations away from root
		-maybe not needed if we make it easier to select tricks that are shouwn in graph
	-Filter out myTricks from allTricks so that I can only see relateds/prereqs/depends that are not
		myTricks

Association Issues:
	-Since there is only prereqs input in form, it is very tempting to put prereqs, depends, and 
	related tricks all in there just so they end up associated in graph.
		-A way to solve this issue is to make 3 dropdowns in the form for each of the 3 types of associations
		-or just make 1 that is related and have the colors indicate what ought to be learned first
			-related should be shown on graph with lines with no arrows
				-it feels kinda strange that my collision tricks are not connected on the graph, 
	-Current related tricks equivalence is non-symmetrical, for example: Box is related to NBox
		 which is related to Luke's shuffle, but Luke's shuffle is not related to NBox which is not related to Box

Editing patterns:
-It is hard to remember what patterns might be prereqs while adding patterns, especially since there all we have is names in the list and many patterns have lots of different names in general
-A way to make associations even for tricks not uploaded by the user is needed
	-we currently have lots of very similar tricks that are not connected on graph
		-if anyone can help create associations it will probably help fix this problem

Adding Patterns:
	-if tags exist that are the same as words in the name of the input pattern, they should be recommended somehow
	-A 'recommended related' list 
		-tricks with the same siteswap
		-a word in common in the title
		-prereq/related in common
	-It would be nice if there was a way to see all tags instead of needing to go through and type each letter to get a bunch of different partial lists. It is very time consuming.
		-Tags dont have universal names so it is tough to know what tags names are being used.

Tags:
	-Users should be allowed to add tags
		-we are nowhere near being cluttered. 
		-The kinds of tricks people will be most motivated to add are ones that are fairly unique to them so they will have tags that we already have. Being unable to tag your pattern is annoying.

List:
	-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
	-Filter by catches does everything myTricks does and much more, if we want simpler code/UI experience we could consider removing myTricks 

Graph:
	-It is hard to go 2 generations out of related tricks because you must look through whole list to select other patterns.
		-Maybe clicking a node should select it and clicking a selected node should open its popup
	-The ability to see related tricks in graph

Popup:
	-Popup should show contributor, and clicking contributor should make it a  tag
	-youtube videos must loop entire video

Stats:
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
		-number of my tricks

Awesome but maybe difficult things:
	-I don't know if it would be possible, but it would be so sweet to be able to have a share 
		button that gives a link to the page with a series of tags already input so I could easily share all my collision patterns
	-Automated instagram uploading if the info(tags, prereqs, ball num..) was in the description
	-Instagram Looping
	-Loop YouTube videos from specific time to specific time, see email for how to do this
		-https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/45884/have-an-embedded-youtube-video-loop-end-at-specified-time-every-time-it-plays
	-get something like x-gif hooked up to a slider to control the speed of the gifs(videos too would be awesome), make it so if you slide it far enough it begins playing the trick backwards(This would be incredibly useful, it would be great if it were somehow possible with videos as well)

Difficulty Coloring Issue:
	-Ideally the difficulty of tricks that I have not yet attempted should be catered to which tricks I can do, but I havnt yet envisioned an algorithm that can accomplish this. It would would be great to know that I can always look at my app and quickly watch a trick being done that I have never done before and just be able to do it. 





















Juggling.tv notes:
	-maybe good to add it because the kind of people who use a vid hosting site specifically for juggling may be likely to use juggledex
	-maybe not good to add it because it looks like their embed says it wont work for iOS

Arrow for indicating the scrollability of cards: (this is most likely not necesaary)
	-should it go away when we are at the bottom?
	-as is an arrow would overlap our tags sometimes, maybe we could not show tags on an edge to leave room
	Ideas:
		-this kind of arrow:
		https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/31104/what-is-the-best-way-to-indicate-that-you-can-scroll-in-an-area-when-the-area-do/31109
		-no arrow solution, just have something half-revealed to make scrollability obvious:
		https://uxdesign.cc/dear-web-designer-let-s-stop-breaking-the-affordance-of-scrolling-fe8bf258df7b

	-find some difficulty/coloring scheme that will work for any case including user added
		-Possible color scheme:
			After user has input catches: 
				Add a 'more catches than I care to count button' and make those tricks difficulty 1. Then all other tricks difficulty automatically set based on input number of catches with the tricks with the most catches being 1, and tricks with least being 10. Allow users to change the difficulty of their own tricks as they see fit.
			Before user has input catches:
				Use the average difficulty rating of all other users for that trick
			Original difficulty of new tricks:
				Set by contributor, but this is just used until an average from other users can be used
