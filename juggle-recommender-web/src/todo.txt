v 1.1:
	-make multi-termed search
	-toggle tricks by user added trick(a tab-esque filter for contributors handles this nicely and makes it possible see specific contributors tricks)
	-make popups be draggable divs
	-sort tricks by date catches updated
	-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)

v 1.0:

	(Ian)-pinch zoom sometimes resets zoom (test again)


==========




Minor:
	-Clicking a popup or the list should bring either in front of the other
	-find sort button with transparent background
		-is this still needed?

Bugs:
	Popup
		Youtube
			-youtube videos don't autoplay
			-youtube videos giving errors, but plays fine besides no autoplay
		Instagram
			-Instagram has no way to loop, they want you to go to their site to loop
				A possible solution may be to check to see when the video ends and then reload the embed
	Misc
		-trick popup and header can both be used to zoom and position each other, but list cannot be 		used that why. What's up with that?
	Maybe unimportant
		-we get this every time:
			Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
		-Update root tricks is running 4 times

Later:
	List:
		-Style expand arrows as icons(Still an issue?)
		-make a 2b section
		-make a 6b and 7b sections
		-allow users to edit tricks that they have contributed
		-allow users to suggest new tags
	Graph:
		-node size based on zoom
		-opacity based on closeness to qualify
		-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
		-make divs draggable
	Misc:
		-Researching other data sources to inform user based tricks(what does this mean?)
		-maybe make a dark theme
	Popup:
		-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the popups
	Add Trick Form:
		-in form, I clicked a tag and the click clicked cancel because it was behind it. This has 
			only happened once, maybe i double clicked without realising.
				*solution is either to limit height(seems like library has no option for this, either make our own tags or edit library) of dropdown or make a timer(even if we do this we still have a mile long list, we could limit list length by requiring more than 1 letter to show suggestions)


Juggling.tv notes:
	-maybe good to add it because the kind of people who use a vid hosting site specifically for juggling may be likely to use juggledex
	-maybe not good to add it because it looks like their embed says it wont work for iOS

Arrow for indicating the scrollability of cards: (this is most likely not necesaary)
	-should it go away when we are at the bottom?
	-as is an arrow would overlap our tags sometimes, maybe we could not show tags on an edge to leave room
	Ideas:
		-this kind of arrow:
		https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/31104/what-is-the-best-way-to-indicate-that-you-can-scroll-in-an-area-when-the-area-do/31109
		-no arrow solution, just have something half-revealed to make scrollability obvious:
		https://uxdesign.cc/dear-web-designer-let-s-stop-breaking-the-affordance-of-scrolling-fe8bf258df7b

	-find some difficulty/coloring scheme that will work for any case including user added
		-Possible color scheme:
			After user has input catches: 
				Add a 'more catches than I care to count button' and make those tricks difficulty 1. Then all other tricks difficulty automatically set based on input number of catches with the tricks with the most catches being 1, and tricks with least being 10. Allow users to change the difficulty of their own tricks as they see fit.
			Before user has input catches:
				Use the average difficulty rating of all other users for that trick
			Original difficulty of new tricks:
				Set by contributor, but this is just used until an average from other users can be used
