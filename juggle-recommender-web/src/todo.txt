Beta:
- make gif smaller for rtina 
-Allow multiple selected tricks
-show all selected tricks in graph
-when a popup is open and a new trick becomes selected, clicking on the empty space doesn't get rid of the popup

User Launch::
	-we want to easily see at a glance which tricks I can do and which I am interested in
	-create user
	-login
	-allow users to add tricks
	-toggle tricks by user added trick


BUGS:
-right now it only sizes a trick as being my trick if it is in the rootlist, we want it to
	size all of my tricks that it shows
Later : 
-Style expand arrows as icons
- add loading graphic
- make checkboxes for showing (related, depends, prereqs) in graph

-fix list card styles for retina

-status property for tricks, 'done'
- clean remaining prereq data exceptions
	there is an orka's mess and an orka's mes
-make a select all button to select all of the tricks in the list (show all relationships, maybe default view)
-add more parameters into the color score like number my tricks related
