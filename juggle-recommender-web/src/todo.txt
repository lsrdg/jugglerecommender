User Launch::
	- allow user add catches (time)
	- hollow and just show thick borders the node with 0 catches
	-we want to easily see at a glance which tricks I can do and which I am interested in
		This could be done with an alternate color scheme color fade based on length of best run. This would eventually result in a much more accurate/personalized difficulty colorring.
	-allow users to add tricks
	-toggle tricks by user added trick

Don't allow state where only graph is showing (limit height)

TAGS:
	-add style
	-(maybe) make it so when a tag is clicked, that tag is added to the current search
	-(maybe) make a checkbox next to search that is 'also search tags', this way if the user knows that the word 'multiplex' is in the name of the trick they seek, they don't have to manually search through all patterns that have multiplex as tag

Next:
-scrape other tutorial links
-scrape siteswap

POPUPS:
-(maybe)list depends and prereqs
-siteswap
- (maybe) other tutorials/user content

BUGS:
-some gifs are smaller than others, for example, Alex is really small
-sometimes clicking a node takes us directly to libraryofjuggling.com, it has to do with the popup opening on mouse down instead of mouse up I think. It only happens when the link lines up with where the mouse is

MINOR:
-make ball num collapse indicator arrows more obvious somehow
- Indicator for which view we are in
- Ask if sure when removing from my list

Later : 
-Style expand arrows as icons
- add loading graphic
- make checkboxes for showing (related, depends, prereqs) in graph

IDEAS:
	-it would be nice to compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
		to do this we would want to be able to show more than one popup
		and maybe made the popups draggable so they can be put right next to each other
	-Might be a good idea to download the whole site incase it gets taken down and we lose the gifs
	-A way to make nodes gravitate towards visible area would be amazing
	-Make learn to juggle nodes, some simple 1b stuff, 2b stuff, the more different patterns the better so they can keep getting that sense of accomplishment. All the two ball steps from the various trucks could even be added with ankmations..

COLORING IDEAS:
- The predone difficulty color could be based on all user data
-  Once you have done a trick, it could be made solid with a color that is hooked up to your length. The range could go from 0(red) to users-longest-trick(green) <-- not sure though, this may be no good with one really long wrong screwing up all other colors.
