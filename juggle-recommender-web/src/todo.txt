v 1.1:
	-make multi-termed search
	-toggle tricks by user added trick
	-we will want usernames instead of just email so we can show them to other users
	-make popups be draggable divs

v 1.0:

	- add tags to filter dropdown
	- add balls to filter dropdown
	-allow users to add tricks
	-(maybe?)Indicator for which view we are in (water mark star background)
	-Make down arrow to show that scrolling is possible on cards
	*should it go away when we are at the bottom?
	*as is an arrow would overlap our tags sometimes, maybe we could not show tags on an edge to leave room,
	- find some coloring scheme that will work for any case including user added

v 0.9:
_______
	-make animation less crazy (vis.js is on archive.org)
	- switch from 3 lists to filter dropdown
	- move sort to search
	- center selection especially when list is open (maybe make graph smaller)
	
v 0.8:
______ 
	- disable analytics from def

==========
POPUPS:
-(maybe?)list depends and prereqs
-(maybe?) other tutorials/user content

Disappears with filters
	-clicking any sort button creates a popup at the 3 ball sort button

Later :
-Style expand arrows as icons
-Researching other data sources to inform user based tricks 
-make a 2b section
-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
- node size based on zoom
- opacity based on closeness to qualify

May disappear with filter route:
	-(maybe?) make it so when a tag is clicked, that tag is added to the current search(or maybe becomes)

Minor:
-Current related tricks equivalence is non-symmetrical, for example: Box is related to NBox which is related to Luke's shuffle, but Luke's shuffle is not related to NBox which is not related to Box
-when the user clicks login it would be nice if the login sliderpane were to close, it looks like
	it would require changing app.isLoginPaneOpen from inside auth.js, so maybe it would involve refactoring things to put the two in the same file
-Clicking a popup or the list should bring either in front of the other
-Maybe closing a popup should reopen the list(furthermore, maybe it should only do this if the list was minimized by the opening of that box)
-if you have a popup open and zoom in to make gif fullscreen then you dont zoom out before closing the pop out, the list may be off screen, maybe the popup should be forced to stay on upper left but not on the header.
-Make search clear gif
-Gif fullscreen button

Filter/Sort Plan:
	-A filter button opens up a fullscreen window, 
		put an X in the corner to return to normal list view
		There are various sections in this filter view
			Tags
			Num of balls (thee should not be tags, they should be radiobuttons that if on can have
				tricks in the root list)
			Sort (A->Z, DIfficulty)
	-Tags can be done with this:(put this in the render: minQueryLength={0} )
		https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-tag-input-1nelrc
	-we can leave search outside of the filter and have it start with cascade typed in so there is not a huge list
	Questions:
		-should tags be 'ands' or 'ors'?
	-Difficulty filter should be a slider
	-Ball num should be a series of checkboxes
	-Tags should have an 'any of' / 'all of' toggle
	










Bug:
Autoscroll doesnt happen if a popup has been opened
