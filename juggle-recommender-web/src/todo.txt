v 1.9
	Profile Screen: (Larger section below)
		-upload image
			ian has code for this

	-Fix list load time

	-Add Trick Form:
		-a way to see info/demo of tricks when deciding what to use as related
		-make consuming tags be added automatically in the list

	-Comments in details

	-Email Notifications

	-Think about leaderboard/details

	Data fix scripts(see list below)

=========
-profile needs 'signed in as..'
-make tags searchable
-get add trick can submit checker split into multiple functions
-put catches flair in profile and filter
-change ninja flair elsewhere(filter and profile)
-details catches icon turn green when catches higher than 0
-catches flair that is out of users control
-put check for other pages in componentDidMount in app.js, but make it its own function
	-invalid siteswaps in the name clear the ballnum and diff, this needs fixed
		-maybe we just want to clear them if it was just previously a valid siteswap
-there should not be a way for a trick to receive a prereq or postreq if it already has it
		-maybe there isn't now, lets see if it keeps happening
-get rid of profile buttons if not logged in
	-if you go from home to add pattern and hit escape, it takes you to list
		-maybe this is fixed by making esc do what the back arrow does

new siteswap checker:
	spit on space, check every word for validity, use largest valid siteswap to fill in
		other fields
	if multiple words dont do lab animation, and dont lock siteswap/ballNum inputs
	never remove ballnum and siteswap autofillins


-get hold down functionality for frame buttons
	-put space above buttons
	-onMouseDown set flag, then run function while flag is set, and onMouseUp remove flag and start a timer that keeps checking if mouseDown flag, if mouse not down, kill timer
	-onTouchHold for mobile, maybe onTouchStart/onTouchEnd that just does the same as the onMouseDown setup

Bugs:
	-frame by frame doesnt hide controls on youtube
	-both timestamps shouldn't be required
	-it sometimes gets a number of catches stuck in its head and when I open a new detail and edit the catches and click on whitespace of card, it sets the catches to the original number. Once it starts doing this it keeps doing it with that same stuck number.
		-not sure if this still happens with new UI

Profile Screen
	Stats
		eventual
			-chart that shows number of patterns in various ranges
			-consecutive days with record break?
			-consecutive days with catches input for a trick?
			-consecutive days with a trick contributed?	

Profile:
	Notifications:(maybe done with email instead)
		-contributed tricks get new related tricks
		-contributed tricks get other users input catches
	Settings: (Maybe this eventualy its own section instead)
		-option to have catch records public or not(listed in details) 

Notifications:
	-'Watch', type of flair to find out if
		-related patterns added
		-users are logging catches with it
		-comments added

-Stats:
	-records broken today

Data fix scripts:
	-a script to make related tricks go both directions
		if x is listed as related for y, then y should be listed for x

Code Cleaning:
	-clean up any trace of allTricksList/myTricksList
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
Minor:
	-thin lines on sort button
	-if all ball nums or all associations are chosen in graph then it is just like none are, should we not show all those tags? should we make the buttons in filter all go gray?


-'suggest a change' form so we dont have to use instagram comments or other methods
	-email through firebase or setup webtask
	https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/quickstarts/email-users
	-on desktop, when detail is showing, would be nice if rootnode gravitated towards open space
		-shrink graph to end at detail

	
-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the details, inserts -1 into the db
	*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1

-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
	-color swatches to indicate difficulty instead of entire background

-make multi-termed search
-filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
-allow users to add new tags

-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

-filter catches are allowed to be empty in which case no patterns are shown
-can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag




(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
