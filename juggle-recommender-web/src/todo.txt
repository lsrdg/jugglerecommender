User Launch::
	-we want to easily see at a glance which tricks I can do and which I am interested in
		This could be done with an alternate color scheme color fade based on length of best run. This would eventually result in a much more accurate/personalized difficulty colorring.
	-create user
	-login
	-allow users to add tricks
	-toggle tricks by user added trick

IDEAS:
	-it would be nice to compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
		to do this we would want to be able to show more than one popup
		and maybe made the popups draggable so they can be put right next to each other
	-Color dots or background in list (same as node)

TAGS:
-add style
-(maybe) make it so when a tag is clicked, that tag is added to the current search
-(maybe) make a checkbox next to search that is 'also search tags', this way if the user knows that the word 'multiplex' is in the name of the trick they seek, they don't have to manually search through all patterns that have multiplex as tag

POPUPS:
-(maybe)list depends and prereqs
-(maybe)show the siteswap of the pattern
-siteswap
-other tutorials/user content

BUGS:
-right now it only sizes a trick as being my trick if it is in the rootlist, we want it to
	size all of my tricks that it shows

MINOR:
-make ball num collapse indicator arrows more obvious somehow
- Indicator for which view we are in
- Ask if sure when removing from my list

Later : 
-Style expand arrows as icons
- add loading graphic
- make checkboxes for showing (related, depends, prereqs) in graph

-fix list card styles for retina

-status property for tricks, 'done'

-add more parameters into the color score like number my tricks related 

-make tags and whatever else go in overflow
-rip other tutorial links
-rip siteswap


A way to make nodes gravitate towards visible area would be amazing

Node border with white center could be undone with border being suggested difficulty, but once you've done it then it is colored based on your length. Maybe color relative to other patterns you've done with that number of props. There could even by some hybrid that takes into account the users as well as some kind of all user data.

Might be a good idea to download the whole site incase it gets taken down and we lose the gifs

I would like to be able to input catches or time for my records.

When search clicked, clear all selected

The predone difficulty color could be based on all user data

Make learn to juggle nodes, some simple 1b stuff, 2b stuff, the more different patterns the better so they can keep getting that sense of accomplishment. All the two ball steps from the various trucks could even be added with ankmations..
