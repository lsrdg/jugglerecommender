==========

Add pattern form bugs:
-either name or siteswap doesnt allow []

-tags dont show up on bottom of most instagram videos


-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
-toggle tricks by user added trick(a tab-esque filter for contributors handles this nicely and makes it possible see specific contributors tricks)

-make multi-termed search
- filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
- allow users to add new tags

-find sort button with transparent background
	-is this still needed?
-Allow cancel add pattern with escape button
-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

- can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a  tag

Stats:
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
		-number of my tricks

		
-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
-opacity based on closeness to qualify








Multiple users edited tag Bugs
z edited trick name
z set catches to 6666
duplicated tab
created x account
x had catches from z account
whenever z edits catches they get set to 0
x edits catches and it works as expected

(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
