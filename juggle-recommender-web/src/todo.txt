		-upload image
			ian has code for this

	-Fix list load time

	-Add Trick Form:
		-a way to see info/demo of tricks when deciding what to use as related
		-make consuming tags be added automatically in the list

	-Comments in details

	-Email Notifications

	-Think about leaderboard/details

	-Get better frame by frame 

	BUGS:
	-details showing postreqs it shouldn't(FIXED but didnt delete note so we would have the info incase ians related bug is still happening)
		TO REPRODUCE: list -> Straight Across (ss1) (1b) details -> Postreq 'Box' Details -> Back arrow (to Straight Across (ss1) (1b)). Now there are postreqs there shouldn't be(temple box & crossed 423 Fake tennis), they are not in the db for Straight Across (ss1) (1b).
		UPDATE: discovered that Box has duplicates of both temple box & crossed 423 Fake tennis, somehow they make their way into the Straight Across (ss1) (1b) list
		FIXED HACKILY: put 'key={Math.random()+"listSection"}' into tricklist.js line 195
		FIXED BETTER: (hack fix removed)dissalow duplicates from being shown in lists even if they are in the db twice. done with 'pushedTrickkeys' in tricklist.js

	Data fix scripts(see list below)

=========
Profile Screen
	Stats
		eventual
			-chart that shows number of patterns in various ranges
			-consecutive days with record break?
			-consecutive days with catches input for a trick?
			-consecutive days with a trick contributed?	

Profile:
	Notifications:(maybe done with email instead)
		-contributed tricks get new related tricks
		-contributed tricks get other users input catches
	Settings: (Maybe this eventualy its own section instead)
		-option to have catch records public or not(listed in details) 

Notifications:
	-'Watch', type of flair to find out if
		-related patterns added
		-users are logging catches with it
		-comments added

-Stats:
	-records broken today

Data fix scripts:
	-a script to make related tricks go both directions
		if x is listed as related for y, then y should be listed for x

Code Cleaning:
	-get add trick can submit checker split into multiple functions
	-clean up any trace of allTricksList/myTricksList
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
Minor:
	-thin lines on sort button
	-if all ball nums or all associations are chosen in graph then it is just like none are, should we not show all those tags? should we make the buttons in filter all go gray?


-'suggest a change' form so we dont have to use instagram comments or other methods
	-email through firebase or setup webtask
	https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/quickstarts/email-users
	-on desktop, when detail is showing, would be nice if rootnode gravitated towards open space
		-shrink graph to end at detail

	
-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the details, inserts -1 into the db
	*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1

-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
	-color swatches to indicate difficulty instead of entire background

-make multi-termed search
-filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
-allow users to add new tags

-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

-filter catches are allowed to be empty in which case no patterns are shown
-can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag




(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
