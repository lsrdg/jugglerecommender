v2.3

	Profile Screen: (Larger section below)
		-upload image
			ian has code for this

	-Add Trick Form:
		-a way to see info/demo of tricks when deciding what to use as related
			-similar to current list, but it's own component probably
			-no catches shown, no relevance, letters highlight, title wont be blue
		-make consuming tags be added automatically in the list

	-add a blurb about random trick box in about

	-extra stats for contributors in contributor page
		-greyed out and 0s if they dont contribute
		query firebase with order by child for contributor number
			-this is the way to filter the list this also works for views, or users with catches

=========
Bugs:
	on Takeout Box, an instagram, slow motion breaks on repeat
		-it uses time ranges
	if i am on details and do a search thing and it takes me to list, back arrow doesnt return me to the last details i was on, it does nothing

Niceties:
	-Show tutorial in unexpanded section
	-filter for 'has tutorial'
	-filter for day range of catches last updated
	-since more and more loj tricks are getting videos and thus ceasing to be contributed by 	loj, maybe we should tag all of them loj. Maybe not if we make a filter for 'has tutorial'

	-see if vote thumb can change colors quicker, maybe before work is done.
		-maybe see if can be done locally if it currently is waiting on db
	-showing the GA map in about or stats or something would be cool


	-autoscroll to voted on card and make it flash when it re-sorts
		-would be nice if it animatedly moved

	-maybe share tap target should be made larger?
		-which share button having issues with?
	-maybe up arrow button that appears on list to zoom to top
	-there should be a way to add gifs even if pattern name is not a siteswap
	-An easy way to combine 2 patterns(just for mods)
		-for instance, Takeouts(4b) and Takeout Multiplex(4b) is the same trick, just one is LOJ, and one is juggling_vegan. Weave and The Weave is another
	-SORT BY:
		-view count, or users working on 
			-maybe not since views are not shown on cards, but maybe this isnt a big deal
	-a way to make playlists, or practice plans, would be nice to keep track of all the tricks of a kind that i want to work on consistantly
	-User made lists for things like 'patterns where all 3 balls line up vertically' or 'easy uncommon patterns' or 'easy to do hard to figure out' or 'hard to do, easy to figure out' or 'tjthejuggler's 5b cascade warmpup'
	-A wanted list where people can post tricks they would like to have
		-this could be not limited to tricks, but also info on existing tricks
		-the list could be hooked up to rewards, like btc
		-wanteds posted by users with accounts only, or the ones with accounts float to top of list





Code Cleaning:
	-how can the timeout in details.suggestRelationClicked() be removed?
	-randomleaderboardtrick could have its name changed to trickOfTheDay or something like that, as well as surrounding variables since it really now has different functionality
	-break up main render function in details.js
	-get add trick can submit checker split into multiple functions
	-clean up any trace of allTricksList/myTricksList
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
	-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
		-is this still a thing?
	-Update root tricks is running more than it needs to maybe
		-this may no longer be a thing

Performance Improvement:
	-if home page stats are calculated on startup, switch to keeping running totals so it loads faster
		-check to see if tricklist or library load on home screen
	-if inside of each tricks info we keep track of all users that have that trick as a myTrick, then when a tricknsme changes we can more quickly update everyone's database.
