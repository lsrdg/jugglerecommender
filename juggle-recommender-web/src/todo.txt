-make search filter my tricks or all tricks (ian)
-my tricks (ian)
-remove trick from my tricks (tj)
-toggle between my tricks and all tricks

	***stuck at the fact that I cant access App.js's state.selectedTricks from inside trickList.js's foreach loop 
-refactor to use global store (ian)
- refactor to select by keys rather than entire object (ian)
- add missing prereqs to jugglingLibrary.js i.e find all prereqs that are not in the library object and add them inside jugglingLibrary.js (tj)

- in my tricks, default graph view is all of my tricks 


Currently:
	
	"trickKey" : { 
		name : "trickNameX",
		prereqs: [trickName1, trickName2] 
	} 


	select by key
	color by key
	filter by key through search
	filter by num 

	graph shows what is shown on list (expanded, searched)
	List shows what is searched

	DATA TODO:
