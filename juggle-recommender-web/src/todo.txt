v 1.8
	Hamburger Menu:
	-profile

	Profile Screen
	-share button to share users contributed
	-upload image
	-personal stats

	Flair
	Stats:
		-records broken today
		-add date to leaderboard
	-Research back arrow 

	Data fix scripts(see list below)

=========

Bugs:
	-it sometimes gets a number of catches stuck in its head and when I open a new detail and edit the catches and click on whitespace of card, it sets the catches to the original number. Once it starts doing this it keeps doing it with that same stuck number.
		-not sure if this still happens with new UI
	-Fixed automatically by back arrow setup:
		-If at main list, go to add trick, hit submit, screen should be scrolled to the top
		-if you go from home to add pattern and hit escape, it takes you to list

Profile:
	Stats:
		Pattern stats:
			-number of tricks within a certain range
			-number of catches
			-consecutive days with record break
			-consecutive days with catches input for a trick
			-consecutive days with a trick contributed
		aggregate stats:
	Notifications:(maybe done with email instead)
		-contributed tricks get new related tricks
		-contributed tricks get other users input catches
	Settings:
		-option to have catch records public or not(listed in details) 

Data fix scripts:
	-a script to make related tags go both directions
		if x is listed as related for y, then y should be listed for x
	-#b moved to begining of name from end (#b)
		-remove the string '(3b)' from entire db
		-anywhere that has the string '(4b)"' should have the '(4b)' removed and '4b' added after the previous "  

Code Cleaning:
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore there are alot fo functions like setTags, they could maybe be combined

Minor:
	-thin lines on sort button

Restyling:
	-put ingstagram icon on list
	-allow contributors to upload pics
	-we should show the currently logged in account up top.
	-frame by frame button
	-maybe reorder filter sections
	-if all ball nums or all associations are chosen in graph then it is just like none are, should we not show all those tags? should we make the buttons in filter all go gray?


-'suggest a change' form so we dont have to use instagram comments or other methods
	-email through firebase or setup webtask
	https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/quickstarts/email-users
	-on desktop, when detail is showing, would be nice if rootnode gravitated towards open space
		-shrink graph to end at detail

	
-A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the details, inserts -1 into the db
	*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1

-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
	-color swatches to indicate difficulty instead of entire background

-make multi-termed search
-filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
-allow users to add new tags

-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

-filter catches are allowed to be empty in which case no patterns are shown
-can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag




(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
