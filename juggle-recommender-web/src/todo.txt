v 1.4
	- shareable filter links
	- make popups be draggable divs 
	- add related relationship
	- add related filter
	- slow/reverse gif
v 1.3:
	-it should also update the library entry for the dependent with the appropriate prereq
		*this is finished, right?
	-a log in firebase for a tricks edited by noncontributor
	- clicking unselected selects, popup only for selected 
		*not sure about this, it adds yet another click to get to the popup, if anything less clicks to get to popup would be nice
	-autocomplete name of added trick to avoid redundant tricks
		*more info down below
	-Google cloud function for changing database to make all 3ball tricks have (3b) after their names
	- remove all button
		*remove all what? Im thinking maybe 'unselect all', but not sure
	- A button that is 'more catches than I want to count' in the popups, inserts -1 into the db
		*instead of -1, maybe better to use negative current number of catches so it can be reveresed, but still set compartamentalized like it can with -1
==========


-to easy to accidentally bump star and delete catches record
-Can't add multiplex siteswaps, restricted symbols are ".", "#", "$", "[", or "]"
-fix constantly collapsing list
	-no need for any auto collapse on pc
	-typing in search should expand list
-editing a tricks name(and probably number, and maybe other fields) deletes it's timeSubmitted field from db
-in filter, number of balls don't change colors when selected
-filter button could look more like sort button

-to avoid pattern submission duplicates:
	-Name AutoComplete
		-it should be like autocomplete for prereqs except it doesnt make a tag, it just fills in the input
		-suggestions should not have any of the ball num parenthesis afterwards,
	-check for videoURL duplicates
		-an extra level of this is just checking if unique part is a duplicate






-edit profile(maybe beyond 1.1)
-toggle tricks by user added trick(a tab-esque filter for contributors handles this nicely and makes it possible see specific contributors tricks)

-make multi-termed search
- filter by num balls 2, 6, 7 or range/even odd
- allow users to add new tags


-Allow cancel add pattern with escape button
-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
-just make sure they are always used together first
-Update root tricks is running 4 times

- can't pinch zoom on list (android)
-filter for unstarred tricks
- recommend tags based on trick name
- recommended related list 
	-tricks with the same siteswap
	-a word in common in the title
	-prereq/related in common
-on mobile, resize list height so it is never behind keyboard.
-The ability to see related tricks in graph

- clicking contributor should make it a tag

Stats:
	Potential pattern stats:
		-number of users with records for a given trick
		-longest run by any user on a given trick(maybe two records one for proven and one for claimed)
	Potential general stats:
		-users signed up
		-users currently online
		-number of all tricks
		-number of my tricks

		
-compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
-opacity based on closeness to qualify








Multiple users edited tag Bugs
z edited trick name
z set catches to 6666
duplicated tab
created x account
x had catches from z account
whenever z edits catches they get set to 0
x edits catches and it works as expected

(name 2 is in seperate, because in incognito)If account 2 has trick open at the time, it crashes them.
	once they referesh, they do not have a record with the changed trick name



check for duplicates in add patterns by comparing video being submitted with all current videos
