Beta:
- make gif smaller for retina 


User Launch::
	-we want to easily see at a glance which tricks I can do and which I am interested in
	-create user
	-login
	-allow users to add tricks
	-toggle tricks by user added trick

IDEAS:
	-it would be nice to compare gifs of different tricks side by side,
		to do this we would want to be able to show more than one popup
		and maybe made the popups draggable so they can be put right next to each other


BUGS:
-right now it only sizes a trick as being my trick if it is in the rootlist, we want it to
	size all of my tricks that it shows
	
Later : 
-Style expand arrows as icons
- add loading graphic
- make checkboxes for showing (related, depends, prereqs) in graph

-fix list card styles for retina

-status property for tricks, 'done'

-add more parameters into the color score like number my tricks related
