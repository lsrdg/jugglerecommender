v2.3

	Profile Screen: (Larger section below)
		-upload image
			ian has code for this

	-Add Trick Form:
		-a way to see info/demo of tricks when deciding what to use as related
		-make consuming tags be added automatically in the list

=========	
-about page looks wanky on mobile
-maybe put something on about page telling users to each time they use the app since it is in active development. There was a Stefan trick add where he was using an old version of the site.

Code Cleaning:
	-how can the timeout in details.suggestRelationClicked() be removed?
	-randomleaderboardtrick could have its name changed to trickOfTheDay or something like that, as well as surrounding variables since it really now has different functionality
	-break up main render function in details.js
	-get add trick can submit checker split into multiple functions
	-clean up any trace of allTricksList/myTricksList
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
	-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
		-is this still a thing?
	-Update root tricks is running more than it needs to maybe
		-this may no longer be a thing

Performance Improvement:
	-if home page stats are calculated on startup, switch to keeping running totals so it loads faster
		-check to see if tricklist or library load on home screen
	-if inside of each tricks info we keep track of all users that have that trick as a myTrick, then when a tricknsme changes we can more quickly update everyone's database.
