			ian has code for this

	-if there is 1 item in an autocomplete list, enter should select that item

	-modignore is currently turned off just by having no names in store.mods because I couldn't figure out how to actually ignore them in GA

=========

-in ga, pageviews are sometimes way lower than events, right now it is 100:10

-on mobile the back arrow is not lined up with the word 'back'
	-on PC stats back arrow/word alignment is different than details and profile, but not sure which is better aligned

-Stefan suggested we do suggestions for tags and siteswap like we did relateds
-bluring small trick list should make them go away and clicking on the input should bring them back. I had it hooked up, but realised that expand broke it.

MAYBES/QUESTIONS:
	GA hooked up to browser back button? our back button? Seperate GAs or same?
	-Patterns mentioned in comments could be links
	-to make the lists less cluttery, dont show patterns with balls of more than 1 more for prereqs, and opposite for post? 
	-if difficulty filters are set on main pattern list, then difficulties higher than that in details become black
		-maybe this is ok, it shows that they are higher than is set in filter, if we ignore filter here then it may be confusing 
	-should flair filters require all selected flairs or any of the selected flairs?
	-make a 'tricks being worked on stat'?
	-make a possible duplicate section when a trick is submitted if there another trick very similarly named, tagged, ballnumber..

-show preview in add trick form so it is easier to get time ranges for instagram videos

Bugs:
	-in add trick form, expanding tricks on multiple (smalltrickslist)related lists messes up demos 
	-instagram videos clicked in tricklist open up thier detail page, youtube videos do not, the video on homescreen also does not.
	-if we load page with flair url that results in no matches, we get endless loading wheel
	-there is a problem with the 'there is a problem with...' message
	-if the name of a trick with lots of relationships is changed it works for a while and then crashes, seems like the change worked after refresh though
	-Scrolling is weird on add trick form, it is like there are two scrollbars and 1 only 		works on green part of form
	-catchCount slowly gets off over time, dunno why
	VIDEO BUGS:
	-if an instagram is using time ranges, slowmotion doesnt stay when it loops forward
	-after about 10 loops, videos get stuck with loading wheel,
		/detail/Claymotion%20Overarm%20Orbits  is a quick looper
	-youtube slowmo back causes glitch if details page changes
	-youtube slowmo back doesnt loop
	-frame by frame doesnt hide controls for youtube


Misc:
	-all users emails are in db on github
	-from stefan
		-On the add patternform: if the submit button is grey you could give hints what the user is missing
			-followup with stefan when i message him about new contributor stats and other issues he mentioned


Niceties:
	-autoscroll to voted on card and make it flash when it re-sorts
		-would be nice if it animatedly moved
		-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27198479/whats-a-react-js-friendly-way-to-animate-a-list-reordering/31080050
	-see if vote thumb can change colors quicker, maybe before work is done.
		-maybe see if can be done locally if it currently is waiting on db
	-showing the GA map in about or stats or something would be cool
	
	-maybe share tap target should be made larger?
		-which share button having issues with?
	-maybe up arrow button that appears on list to zoom to top
	-there should be a way to add gifs even if pattern name is not a siteswap
	-An easy way to combine 2 patterns(just for mods)
		-for instance, Takeouts(4b) and Takeout Multiplex(4b) is the same trick, just one is LOJ, and one is juggling_vegan. Weave and The Weave is another
	-SORT BY:
		-view count, or users working on 
			-maybe not since views are not shown on cards, but maybe this isnt a big deal
	-a way to make playlists, or practice plans, would be nice to keep track of all the tricks of a kind that i want to work on consistantly
	-User made lists for things like 'patterns where all 3 balls line up vertically' or 'easy uncommon patterns' or 'easy to do hard to figure out' or 'hard to do, easy to figure out' or 'tjthejuggler's 5b cascade warmpup'
	-A wanted list where people can post tricks they would like to have
		-this could be not limited to tricks, but also info on existing tricks
		-the list could be hooked up to rewards, like btc
		-wanteds posted by users with accounts only, or the ones with accounts float to top of list

Code Cleaning:
	-consolidate the sort alg in utilities into several smaller functions
	-all those setStates in addTrickForm in componentdidmount, if (editing trick) may be redundant
	-reduce stuff at begining of filterstore into a more general function
	-how can the timeout in details.suggestRelationClicked() be removed?
	-randomleaderboardtrick could have its name changed to trickOfTheDay or something like that, as well as surrounding variables since it really now has different functionality
	-break up main render function in details.js
	-get add trick can submit checker split into multiple functions
	-clean up any trace of allTricksList/myTricksList
		-uiStore.updateRootTricks still has something of this
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
	-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
		-is this still a thing?
	-Update root tricks is running more than it needs to maybe
		-this may no longer be a thing
	-updateroottricks gets run when a trick is clicked on the list(probably any time details is entered into)

Performance Improvement:
	-when we go to a details page of a youtube trick, we get a firebase warning about adding security rule to increase performance
	-if home page stats are calculated on startup, switch to keeping running totals so it loads faster
		-check to see if tricklist or library load on home screen
	-if inside of each tricks info we keep track of all users that have that trick as a myTrick, then when a trick name changes we can more quickly update everyone's database.
